Restat 2d of Contracts, § Scope  
 
Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 1 - Meaning of Terms  
 
Introductory Note   
 
A persistent source of difficulty in the law of contracts is the fact that words often have different meanings 
to the speaker and to the hearer.  Most words are commonly used in more than one sense, and the words used in this  Restatement are no exception.  It is arguable that the difficulty is increased rather than 
diminished by an attempt to give a word a single definition and to use it only as defined.  But where usage varies widely, definition makes it possible to avoid cir cumlocution in the statement of rules and to hold 
ambiguity to a minimum. 
In the Restatement, an effort has been made to use only words with connotations familiar to the legal 
profession, and not to use two or more words to express the same legal concept.  Where a word frequently 
used has a variety of distinct meanings, one meaning has been selected and indicated by definition.  But it is obviously impossible to capture in a definition an entire complex institution such as "contract" or "promise." The opera tive facts necessary or sufficient to create legal relations and the legal relations 
created by those facts will appear with greater fullness in the succeeding chapters

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 1 - Meaning of Te rms 
 
§ 1 Contract Defined   
 
A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or 
the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Other meanings .  The word "contract" is often used with meanings different from that given here.  
It is sometimes used as a synonym for"agreement" or "bargain." It may refer to legally ineffective agreements, or to wholly executed transactions such as conveyances; it may refer ind ifferently to the 
acts of the parties, to a document which evidences those acts, or to the resulting legal relations.  In a statute the word may be given still other meanings by context or explicit definition.  As is indicated in the Introductory Note to t he Restatement of this Subject, definition in terms of "promise" excludes 
wholly executed transactions in which no promises are made; such a definition also excludes analogous obligations imposed by law rather than by virtue of a promise. b.  Act and resulting legal relations .  As the term is used in the Restatement of this Subject, "contract," 
like "promise," denotes the act or acts of promising.  But, unlike the term "promise," "contract" applies only to those acts which have legal effect as stated in the definition given.  Thus the word "contract" is 
commonly and quite properly also used to refer to the resulting legal obligation, or to the entire resulting complex of legal relations.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code § 1- 201(11), defining 
"contract" in terms of "the total legal obligation which results from the parties' agreement."  
c.  Set of promises .  A contract may consist of a single promise by one person to another, or of mutual 
promises by two persons to one another; or there may be, indeed, any number of persons or any number of promises.  One person may make several promises to one person or to several persons, or several persons may join in making promises to one or more persons.  To constitute a "set," promises need not be made simultaneously; it is enough that several promises are regarded by the parties as constituting a single contract, or are so related in subject matter and performance that they may be considered and enforced together by a court. d.  Operative acts other than promise .  The def inition does not attempt to state what acts are essential 
to create a legal duty to perform a promise.  In many situations other acts in addition to the making of a promise are essential, and the formation of the contract is not completed until those acts take place.  For example, an act may be done as the consideration for a contract (see § 71), and may be essential to the creation of a legal duty to perform the promise (see § 17).  Similarly, delivery is required for the formation of a contract under seal  (see § 95).  Such acts are not part of the promise, and are not 
specifically included in the brief definition of contract adopted here. e.  Remedies .  The legal remedies available when a promise is broken are of various kinds.  Direct 
remedies of damages,  restitution and specific performance are the subject of Chapter 16.  Whether or 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 1  
 josh glen  Page 7 of 189 not such direct remedies are available, the law may recognize the existence of legal duty in some other 
way such as recognizing or denying a right, privilege or power created or terminated by the promise. Illustration: 
1.  A orally agrees to sell land to B; B orally agrees to buy the land and pays $ 1000 to A.  The 
agreement is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.  B's right to restitution of the $ 1000, however, is gover ned by the same rules as if the agreement were enforceable.  B has a right to recover 
the $ 1000 paid if A refuses to convey the land, but not if A is ready and willing to convey.  See § 140 and the provisions on restitution in § 375.  By virtue of this indirect recognition of the duty to convey, the agreement is a contract.  
f.  Varieties of contracts .  The term contract is generic.  As commonly used, and as here defined, it 
includes varieties described as voidable, unenforceable, formal, informal, express, implied (see 
Comment a to § 4), unilateral, bilateral.  In these varieties neither the operative acts of the parties nor 
the resulting relations are identical.  
g.  "Binding promise ."  A promise which is a contract is said to be "binding." As the term "contract" is 
defined, a statement that a promise is binding does not necessarily mean that any particular remedy is available in the event of breach, or indeed that any remedy is available.  Because of the limitations inherent in stating or illustrating rules  for the legal relations resulting from promises, it frequently 
becomes necessary to indicate that a legal duty to perform arises from the facts stated, assuming the absence of other facts.  In order to avoid the connotation that the duty stated exists under all circumstances, the word "binding" or a statement that the promisor is "bound" is used to indicate that the duty arises if the promisor has full capacity, if there is no illegality or fraud in the transaction, if the duty has not been discharged, and if there are no other similar facts which would defeat the prima 
facie duty which is stated.

of Contract (1974); Friedman, Contract Law in America: A Social and Economic Case Study (1965); Symposium, The Relevance of Contract Theory, 1967 Wis. L. Rev. 303; Macauley, Contract Law and Contract Re search, 20 J. Legal Ed. 452 (1968); Farnsworth, The Past of Promise: An Historical

its relation to tort actions for fraud, see Steinberg v. Chicago Medical School, 69 Ill.2d 320, 371 
N.E.2d 634 (1977) . 
Comment e .  Illustration 1 is new.  
Comment f .  Section 12 of the original Restatement defined unilateral and bilateral contracts.  It has 
not been carried forward because of doubt as to the utility of the distinction, often treated as 
fundamental, between the two types.  As defined in the original Restatement, "unilateral contract" included three quite different types of transaction: (1) the promise which does not contemplate a bargain, such as the promise under seal to make  a gift, (2) certain option contracts, such as the option 
under seal (see §§ 25, 45), and (3) the bargain completed on one side, such as the loan which is to be repaid.  This grouping of unlike transactions was productive of confusion. 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 1  
 josh glen  Page 8 of 189 Moreover, as to bargains, the distinction tends to suggest, erroneously, that the obligation to repay a 
loan is somehow different if the actual delivery of the money was preceded by an advance commitment from the obligation resulting from a simultaneous loan and commitment.  It also causes confusion in cases where performance is complete on one side except for an incidental or collateral promise, as where an offer to buy goods is accepted by shipment and a warranty is implied.  Finally, the effect of the distinction has been t o exaggerate the importance of the type of bargain in which one 
party begins performance without making any commitment, as in the classic classroom case of the promise to pay a reward for climbing a flagpole. 
The principal value of the distinction has been  the emphasis it has given to the fact that a promise is 
often binding on the promisor even though the promisee is not bound by any promise.  This value is 
retained in § 25 on option contracts.  But the terms unilateral and bilateral are generally avoided in this Restatement.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 1 - Meaning of Terms  
 
§ 2 Promise; Promisor; Promisee; Beneficiary   
 
(1)  A promise is a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so 
made as to justify a promisee in understanding that a commitment has been made.  
(2)  The person manifesting the intention is the promisor.  
(3)  The person to whom the manifestation is addressed is the promisee.  
(4)  Where performance will benefit a person other than the promisee, that person is a beneficiary.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Acts and resulting relations .  "Promise" as used in the Restatement of this Subject denotes the act 
of the promisor.  If by virtue of other operative facts there is a legal duty to perform, the promise is a contract; but the word "promise" is not limited to acts having legal effect.  Like "contract," however, the word "promise" is commonly and quite properly also used to refer to the complex of human relations which results from the promisor's words or acts of assurance, including the justified 
expectations of the promisee and any moral or legal duty which arises to make good the assurance by performance.  The performance may be specified either in terms describing the action of the promisor or in terms of the result which that action or inaction is to bring about. b.  Manifestation of intention .  Many contract disputes arise because different people attach different 
meanings to the same words and conduct.  The phrase "manifestation of intention"  adopts an external 
or objective standard for interpreting conduct; it means the external expression of intention as distinguished from undisclosed intention.  A promisor manifests an intention if he believes or has reason to believe that the promisee will  infer that intention from his words or conduct.  Rules 
governing cases where the promisee could reasonably draw more than one inference as to the promisor's intention are stated in connection with the acceptance of offers (see §§ 19 and 20), and the scope of contractual obligations (see §§ 201, 219). c.  Promise of action by third person; guaranty .  Words are often used which in terms promise action 
or inaction by a third person, or which promise a result obtainable only by such action.  Such words are com monly understood as a promise of conduct by the promisor which will be sufficient to bring 
about the action or inaction or result, or to answer for harm caused by failure.  An example is a guaranty that a third person will perform his promise.  Such words constitute a promise as here defined only if they justify a promisee in an expectation of some action or inaction on the part of the promisor. 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 2  
 josh glen  Page 10 of 189 d.  Promise of event beyond human control; warranty .  Words which in terms promise that an event 
not within human control will occur may be interpreted to include a promise to answer for harm 
caused by the failure of the event to occur.  An example is a warranty of an existing or past fact, such 
as a warranty that a horse is sound, or that a ship arrived in a foreign port some days previously.  Such 
promises are often made when the parties are ignorant of the actual facts regarding which they bargain, and may be dealt with as if the warrantor could cause the fact to be as he asserted.  It is then immaterial that the a ctual condition of affairs may be irrevocably fixed before the promise is made. 
Words of warranty, like other conduct, must be interpreted in the light of the circumstances and the reasonable expectations of the parties.  In an insurance contract, a "warra nty" by the insured is usually 
not a promise at all; it may be merely a representation of fact, or, more commonly, the fact warranted is a condition of the insurer's duty to pay (see § 225(3)).  In the sale of goods, on the other hand, a similar warranty n ormally also includes a promise to answer for damages (see Uniform Commercial 
Code § 2-715). Illustrations:  
1.  A, the builder of a house, or the inventor of the material used in part of its construction, says to B, the owner of the house, "I warrant that this house will never burn down." This includes a promise to pay for harm if the house should burn down. 
2.  A, by a charter -party, undertakes that the "good ship Dove," having sailed from Marseilles a week 
ago for New York, shall take on a cargo for B on her arrival in New York.  The statement of the 
quality of the ship and the statement of her time of sailing from Marseilles include promises to pay for harm if the statement is untrue.  
e.  Illusory promises; mere statements of intention .  Words of promise which by their terms make 
performance entirely optional with the "promisor" whatever may happen, or whatever course of conduct in other respects he may pursue, do not constitute a promise.  Although such words are often referred to as forming an illusory p romise, they do not fall within the present definition of promise.  
They may not even manifest any intention on the part of the promisor.  Even if a present intention is manifested, the reservation of an option to change that intention means that there can be no promisee 
who is justified in an expectation of performance. 
On the other hand, a promise may be made even though no duty of performance can arise unless some 
event occurs (see §§ 224, 225(1)).  Such a conditional promise is no less a promise because  there is 
small likelihood that any duty of performance will arise, as in the case of a promise to insure against fire a thoroughly fireproof building.  There may be a promise in such a case even though the duty to perform depends on a state of mind of the  promisor other than his own unfettered wish (see § 228), or 
on an event within the promisor's control. Illustration: 
3.  A says to B, "I will employ you for a year at a salary of $ 5,000 if I go into business." This is a 
promise, even though it is wholly optional with A to go into business or not. f.  Opinions and predictions .  A promise must be distinguished from a statement of opinion or a mere 
prediction of future events.  The distinction is not usually difficult in the case of an informal gratuitous opinion, since there is often no manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting or to bring about a result, no expectation of performance and no consideration.  The problem is frequently presented, however, whether words of a seller of goods amount  to a warranty.  Under Uniform 
Commercial Code § 2 -313(2) a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion does not create a 
warranty, but the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill and judgment may create an implied warranty 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 2  
 josh glen  Page 11 of 189 that the goods are fit  for a particular purpose under Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 315.  In any case 
where an expert opinion is paid for, there is likely to be an implied promise that the expert will act 
with reasonable care and skill.  
A promise often refers to future events whi ch are predicted or assumed rather than promised.  Thus a 
promise to render personal service at a particular future time commonly rests on an assumption that the promisor will be alive and well at that time; a promise to paint a building may similarly rest  on an 
assumption that the building will be in existence.  Such cases are the subject of Chapter 11.  The promisor may of course promise to answer for harm caused by the failure of the future event to occur; if he does not, such a failure may discharge any duty of performance. Illustration: 
4.  A, on seeing a house of thoroughly fireproof construction, says to B, the owner, "This house will 
never burn down." This is not a promise but merely an opinion or prediction.  If A had been paid for his opinion as an expert, there might be an implied promise that he would employ reasonable care and 
skill in forming and giving his opinion. g.  Promisee and beneficiary .  The word promisee is used repeatedly in discussion of the law of 
contracts, and it cannot be avoided here.  In common usage the promisee is the person to whom the promise is made; as promise is defined here, the promisee might be the person to whom the manifestation of the promisor's intention is communicated.  In many situations, however, a promise is complete and binding before the communication is received (see, for example, §§ 63 and 104(1)).  To cover such cases, the promisee is defined here as the addressee.  As to agents or purported agents of the addressee, see § 52 Comment c . 
In the usual situation the promisee also bears other relations to the promisor, and the word promisee is sometimes used to refer to one or more of those relations.  Thus, in  the simple case of a loan of 
money, the lender is not only the addressee of the promise but also the person to whom performance is to be rendered, the person who will receive economic benefit, the person who furnished the consideration, and the person to whom the legal duty of the promisor runs.  As the word promisee is here defined, none of these relations is essential.  
Contractual rights of persons not parties to the contract are the subject of Chapter 14.  The promisor and promisee are the "parties" to a promise; a third person who will benefit from performance is a "beneficiary." A beneficiary may or may not have a legal right to performance; like "promisee", the term is neutral with respect to right and duties.  A person who is entitled under the terms  of a letter of 
credit to draw or demand payment is commonly called a beneficiary, but such a person is ordinarily a promisee under the present definition.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 5-103. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section substitutes the concept of a "manifestation of intention to act . . ." for the phrase used in former § 2(1): "an undertaking . . . that something shall happen. . . ." The older definition did not identify the essential characteristics of an undertaking.  See Gardner, An Inquiry Into t he Principles of 
Contracts, 46 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 5 (1932). The present definition of promise is based on 1 Corbin, Contracts § 13 (1963 & Supp. 1980).  See also 1 id. § 15; 1 Williston, Contracts § 1A (3d ed. 1957).  The definitions of "promisor," "promise"  and "beneficiary" are new.  Compare Gardner, 
Massachusetts Annotations, Restatement of Contracts, Chapter 6, at 64 (1935).

§ 3 Agreement Defined; Bargain Defined   
 
An agreement is a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons.  A bargain 
is an agreement to exchange promises or to exchange a promise for a performance or to exchange performances.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Agreement distinguished from bargain.  Agreement has in some respects a wider meaning than contract, bargain or promise.  On the other hand, there are contracts which do not require agreement.  See, e.g., §§ 82- 90, 94, 104.  The word "agreement" contains no implication that legal consequences 
are or are not produced.  It applies to transactions executed on one or both sides, and also to those that are wholly executory.  The word contains no implication of mental agreement.  Such agreement usually but not always exists where the parties manifest assent to a transaction.  
b.  Manifestation of assent .  Manifestation of assent may be made by words or by any other conduct 
(see § 19).  Even silence in some circumstances is such a manifestation (see § 69).  Compare the definition of "agreement" in Uniform Commercial Code § 1-201(3). c.  Bargain distinguished from agreement .  Bargain has a narrower meaning than agreement, since it is 
applicable only to a particular class of agreements.  It includes agreements which are not contracts, such as transactions where one party makes a promise and the other gives something in exchange which is not consideration, or transactions where what would otherwise be a contract is invalidated by illegality.  As here defined, it includes completely executed transactions, such as exchanges of goods (barters) or of services, or sales where goods have been transferred and the price paid for them, although such transactions are not within the scope of this Restatement unless a promise is made.  
d.  Offer .  A bargain is ordinarily made by an offer by one party and an acceptance by the other party 
or parties, the offer specifying the two subjects of exchange to which the offeror is manifesting assent (see §§  22 and 24). 
e.  Contract distinguished from bargain.  A contract is not necessarily a bargain.  Thus, a promise to 
make a gift, if made under seal, may be a contract (see § 95), but it is not a bargain.  Other contracts which are not bargains are the subj ect of §§ 82 -94.  Such contracts do not require manifestations of 
mutual assent in the form of offer and acceptance.

§ 4 How a Promise May Be Made   
 
A promise may be stated in words either oral or written, or may be inferred wholly or partly 
from conduct.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Express and implied contracts.  Contracts are often spoken of as express or implied.  The 
distinction involves, however, no difference in legal effect, but lies merely in the mode of manifesting assent.  Just as assent may be manifested by words or other conduct, sometimes including silence, so intention to make a promise may be manifested in language or by implication from other circumstances, including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 1 -201(3), defining "agreement." 
Illustrations:  
1.  A telephones to his groce r, "Send me a ten -pound bag of flour." The grocer sends it.  A has thereby 
promised to pay the grocer's current price therefor.  
2.  A, on passing a market, where he has an account, sees a box of apples marked "25 cts. each." A picks up an apple, holds it up so that a clerk of the establishment sees the act.  The clerk nods, and A passes on.  A has promised to pay twenty-five cents for the apple. b.  Quasi- contracts.  Implied contracts are different from quasi -contracts, although in some cases the 
line between the two is indistinct.  See Comment a to § 19.  Quasi -contracts have often been called 
implied contracts or contracts implied in law; but, unlike true contracts, quasi- contracts are not based 
on the apparent intention of the parties to undertake the performances in question, nor are they promises.  They are obligations created by law for reasons of justice.  Such obligations were ordinarily enforced at common law in the same form of action (assumpsit) that was appropriate to true contracts, and some conf usion with reference to the nature of quasi -contracts has been caused thereby.  They are 
dealt with in the Restatement of Restitution.  See also §§ 141, 158, 197-99, 272, 370-77. Illustration: 
3.  A's wife, B, separates from A for justifiable cause, and, i n order to secure necessary clothing and 
supplies, buys them from C and charges their cost to A.  A is bound to pay for them, though he has 
directed C not to furnish his wife with such supplies; but A's duty is quasi -contractual, not contractual.  
See Rest atement of Restitution § 113. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is derived from former § 5, but is substantially reworded.  See 1 Williston, Contracts §§ 3-3A (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts §§ 18-19 (1963 & Supp. 1980).

 josh glen  Page 16 of 189 Comment a .  A major source of confus ion in this area is the use of the term "implied in fact" for actual 
but nonverbal contracts inferred from facts such as the parties' conduct.  See Reporter's Note to § 19.

of § 69(2) is not an exception to the requirements of this Section, but a statement of an obligation that 
does not rest on a manifestation of intention. 
Comment b .  As opposed to the inferred from fact ("implied in fact") contract, the "implied in law" 
quasi- contract is no contract at all, but a form of the remedy of restitution.  On the difference, see

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 1 - Meaning of Terms  
 
§ 5 Terms of Promise, Agreement, or Contract   
 
(1)  A term of a promise or agreement is that portion of the intention or assent manifested which 
relates to a particular matter.  
(2)  A term of a contract is that portion of the legal relations resulting from the promise or set of promises which relates to a particular matter, whether or not the parties manifest an intention to create those relations.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Agreed terms.  The terms of a promise or agreement are those expressed in the language of the parties or implied in fact from other conduct.  Both language and conduct are to be understood in the light of the circumstances, including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance.  See Comment a to § 4.  If a promise is binding, a term of the promise becomes a term of the contract 
unless it is rendered inoperative by some rule of law.  
b.  Contract terms supplied by law .  Much contract law consists of rules which may be varied by 
agreement of the par ties.  Such rules are sometimes stated in terms of presumed intention, and they 
may be thought of as implied terms of an agreement.  They often rest, however, on considerations of public policy rather than on manifestation of the intention of the parties.  In the Restatement of this 
Subject, such rules are stated in terms of the operative facts which make them applicable.  
c.  Statutory contract terms .  Statutes providing for contract terms vary in the extent to which they 
follow the terminology used here, and in the extent to which they permit variation by agreement.  Under Uniform Commercial Code § 1- 102(3), for example, the effect of provisions of the Code may 
be freely varied by agreement, with limited exceptions; at the other extreme are statutes or admi nistrative regulations prescribing standard forms of such documents as insurance policies or bills 
of lading. Transactions entered into under statutes providing either optional or required terms commonly contain promises within the present definition, but they may also produce obligations which do not rest upon any manifestation of the intention of the obligor. 
Such statutory obligations are beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  The statutes are 
sometimes written in terms of presumed intenti on, and they are sometimes properly interpreted as 
imposing the same legal consequences as if one of the parties to a contract had made a promise in the prescribed terms.  If so, rules stated here may be applicable.  
Illustration: 
1.  A contracts to sell B a described automobile.  Both parties sign a printed contract form on which 
the description is typed and which contains the printed words, "Seller hereby excludes all warranties, express or implied." Under Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -316 the quoted words do not exclude an 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 5  
 josh glen  Page 18 of 189 implied warranty of merchantability, and under § 2- 314 A warrants that the automobile is fit to drive.  
Under § 2-714 the warranty has the effect of a promise to pay for harm if the warranty is broken. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is new.   See 1 Williston, Contracts §§ 1, 1A, 2 (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts §§ 3, 9, 
13 (1963 & Supp. 1980). 
Comments a and b.  The choice of terms is primarily a power of the parties to a contract.  Nonetheless, their freedom of choice is increasingly circumscribed by rules of law.  A term may be unenforceable because it offends public policy, § 178; or because it is unconscionable, § 208.  It generally will be interpreted against the draftsman, § 206, and in a manner favoring the public, § 207.  In some circumstances terms in standardized agreements will not be enforced despite the adhering party's 
manifestation of assent, Comment c to § 211; and affirmative relief such as injunction and specific 
performance may be denied because terms are unfair even thou gh the terms would be enforced in an 
action for damages, § 364. 
Comment c .  As to statutory contract terms see Kessler, Contracts of Adhesion -- Some Thoughts 
about Freedom of Contract, 43 Colum. L. Rev. 629 (1943); Lenhoff, Optional Terms (Jus Dispositivu m) and Required Terms (Jus Cogens) in the Law of Contracts, 45 Mich. L. Rev. 39 (1946). 
As to bills of lading, see 10 Williston, Contracts § 1078 (3d ed. 1957).  The Federal Trade Commission has promulgated Trade Regulation Rules requiring that many consum er contracts contain 
specified terms giving consumers rights or forbidding the waiver of those rights.  See, e.g., 16 C.F.R. 
§ 433.1 -.3 (1975) (preserving consumers' claims and defenses against holders in due course or 
assignees); 16 C.F.R. § 429.1 (1974)  (giving buyers in door -to-door transactions three days to rescind 
the contract).  Ill ustration 1 is new.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 1 - Meaning of Terms  
 
§ 6 Formal Contracts   
 
The following types of contracts are subject in some respects to special rules that depend on 
their formal characteristics and differ from those governing contracts in general:  
(a)  Contracts under seal,  
(b)  Recognizances,  
(c)  Negotiable instruments and documents,  
(d)  Letters of credit.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  "Formal contracts ."  The contracts referred to in this Section are sometimes referred to as  "formal 
contracts," and other contracts may then be called "informal" or "simple" contracts.  This usage is avoided in this Restatement because contracts other than those enumerated are also subject to formal requirements.  Thus statutes modeled on the English Statute of Frauds make certain classes of contracts unenforceable unless evidenced by a writing; rules developed under such statutes are stated in Chapter 5.  Similarly, Uniform Commercial Code § 9- 201 gives effect to a "security agreement" 
according to its terms, with exceptions which include the specification of formal requisites in § 9 -203.  
Except for contracts under seal, the special rules governing the contracts enumerated in this Section are not stated in the Restatement of this Subject.  Many of the rules here stated as applicable to contracts in general also have application to these special types of contract.  See, for example, Uniform Commercial Code § 1-103. b.  Contracts under seal .  The rules governing the formation of sealed contracts ar e stated in Chapter 
4, and peculiar incidents attached to such contracts after formation are referred to where appropriate.  In many States the legal effect of seals has been modified or abolished by statute.  Under Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -203, contracts or offers to buy or sell goods are not contracts under seal even 
though a seal is affixed.  Under Uniform Commercial Code § 3- 113, a negotiable instrument under 
seal is nevertheless subject to Article 3 of the Code, including the rule of § 3- 408 that wa nt or failure 
of consideration is a defense.  
c.  Recognizances .  A recognizance is an acknowledgment in court by the recognizor that he is bound 
to make a certain payment unless a specified condition is performed.  They are in use chiefly to secure, first,  the attendance in court at a future day of the recognizor, or, second, the prosecution of an 
action, or, third, the payment of bail.  
d.  Negotiable instruments .  Negotiable instruments are such drafts, certificates of deposit, and 
promissory notes as are payable to bearer or to the order of a specified person, and such bonds, 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 6  
 josh glen  Page 20 of 189 certificates of shares of stock, and other investment securities as are in bearer or registered form.  In 
every State they are subject either to Article 3 or Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code or to the older statutes, the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law and the Uniform Stock Transfer Act. e.  Negotiable documents .  Negotiable documents are such warehouse receipts, bills of lading, and 
other documents of title as run to bearer  or to the order of a named person, or, where recognized in 
overseas trade, to a named person or assigns.  Warehouse receipts are subject in every State either to Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code or to the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.  Interstat eand 
export bills of lading are subject to the Federal Bills of Lading Act; import and local bills are subject in most States to Article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code or to the Uniform Bills of Lading Act.  
f.  Letters of credit .  A letter of credit is a  promise to honor drafts or other demands for payment which 
is within the scope of Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code.  The Code defines that scope, prescribes formal requirements, provides that no consideration is necessary to establish a letter of credit, and partially codifies the governing law.  The governing law is closely related to the law of negotiable instruments; it has been developed from the law merchant and influenced by Section 135 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law and by statutes and usages relating to banking.  The Uniform Commercial Code makes no radical change in the law developed by judicial decision. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is based on former § 7, with the addition of letters of credit.  The material covered by former §§ 8- 11 is dealt with in the Comments to this Section.  See 1 Williston, Contracts §§ 4- 7 (3d 
ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts § 5 (1963).  As to letters of credit, see Murray, Contracts § 5 (2d rev. ed. 1974). Comment b .  Contracts under seal are discussed at length in 1 Williston, Contracts §§ 205- 19A (3d ed. 
1957); and in 1A Corbin, Contracts §§ 240- 57 (1963).  See also Topic 3 of Chapter 4 of this 
Restatement.  
Comment c .  Recognizances are discussed in 1 Williston, Contracts § 220 (3d ed. 1957); and in 1A  
Corbin, Contracts § 258 (1963). Comment d .  Negotiable instruments as formal contracts are discussed in 1 Williston, Contracts § 221 
(3d ed. 1957).  On the formal requirements of negotiable instruments, see UCC § 3- 104 and Comment 
2 thereto. Comment e .  On the formal requirements and effect of documents of title, see UCC §§ 1- 201(15) and 
7-202 (warehouse receipts); 49 U.S.C. §§ 83-85, 89-91 (1970) (order bills of lading). Comment f .  Neither Williston nor Corbin expressly includes letters of credit in his list of formal 
contracts, but they satisfy the element stressed by both writers --  that form rather than the underlying 
transaction is the key element of the contract.  Cf. UCC § 5- 105; Comments 1 and 2 to UCC § 5-114; 
compare, however, UCC § 5-104.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 1 - Meaning of Terms  
 
§ 7 Voidable Contracts   
 
A voidable contract is one where one or more parties have the power, by a manifestation of 
election to do so, to avoid the legal relations created by the contract, or by ratifica tion of the 
contract to extinguish the power of avoidance. 
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  "Void contracts ."  A promise for breach of which the law neither gives a remedy nor otherwise 
recognizes a duty of performance by the promisor is often called a void contract.  Under § 1, however, 
such a promise is not a contract at all; it is the "promise" or "agreement" that is void of legal effect.  If the term "contract" were defined to refer to the acts of the parties without regard to their legal effect, a 
contract could without inconsistency be referred to as "void." b.  Grounds of avoidance .  Typical instances of voidable contracts are those where one party was an 
infant, or where the contract was induced by fraud, mistake, or duress, or where breach of a warranty or other promise justifies the aggrieved party in putting an end to the contract.  Usually the power to avoid is confined to one party to the contract, but where, for instance, both parties are infants, or where both parties enter into a contract under a mutual mistake, the contract may be voidable by either one of the parties.  Avoidance is often referred to as "disaffirmance."  
c.  Consequences of avoidance .  The legal relations that exist after avoidance vary with the 
circumstances.  In some cases the party who avoids the contract is entitled to be restored to a position as good as that which he occupied immediately before the formation of the contract; in other cases the parties may be left in the same condition as at the time of the avoidance.   In many cases the power of 
avoidance exists only if the original situation of the parties can be and is restored at least substantially; but this is not necessarily the case.  An infant, for instance, in many jurisdictions is allowed to avoid his contract without this qualification, so that when the infant exercises his power the parties frequently are left in a very different situation from that which existed when the contract was made.  See § 14; Restatement of Restitution § 62.  As to breach of contract, see Chapters 10 and 16 of this Restatement; as to mistake, misrepresentation, duress and undue influence, see Chapters 6 and 7.  
Illustration: 
1.  A, an infant, sells and delivers his watch to B, an adult, in return for B's promise to pay $ 20.  
There is a contract whereby B becomes owner of the watch and is under an enforceable duty to pay $ 
20 to A.  But A has the power to extinguish his own right to the money and B's duty to pay it and, as against B, to revest in himself the ownership of the watch.  
d.  Promptness of election .  Voidable contracts differ with respect to the requirement that the avoiding 
party manifest his election promptly.  In some cases the power of avoidance may be lost by unreasonable delay in returning benefits received or in manifesting the election to avoid.  In other 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 7  
 josh glen  Page 22 of 189 cases, particularly where the contract is entirely executory on both sides, no manifestation of intention 
is necessary until an action is brought against the party having the power of avoidance. Illustrations:  
2.  A, by fraud, induces B to make a promise to pay A money in consideration of goods delivered by A to B.  There is a contract, but the fraudulent representations of A give B a power to avoid by tendering back to A within a reasonable time the goods received from him.  
3.  A, an infant, makes an agreement with B, an adult, the infant promising to pay money and the adult promising to deliver a chattel.  This is enforceable against B, but not against A.  If A has not previously avoided, he will have the power of rati fication upon attaining his majority.  
e.  Power of ratification .  The propriety of calling a transaction a voidable contract rests primarily on 
the traditional view that the transaction is valid and has its usual legal consequences until the power of avoidance is exercised.  Where each party has a power of avoidance, there is no legal duty of performance; but the term voidable contract is appropriate if ratification by one of the parties would terminate his power of avoidance and make the contract enforceable against him.  See § 85.  Moreover, action may be necessary in order to prevent the contract from producing the ordinary legal consequences of a contract; often such action in order to be effectual must be taken promptly. Illustration: 
4.  A, by fraud, induces B to promise to pay for certain advice which A gives.  This promise creates no 
duty in B, but is not wholly void, because it can be validated by B after he learns the facts.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 1 - Meaning of Terms  
 
§ 8 Unenforceable Contracts   
 
An unenforceable contract is one for the breach of which neither the remedy of damages nor the 
remedy of specific performance is available, but which is recognized in some other way as creating a duty of performance, though there has been no ratification.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Distinction between "voidable" and "unenforceable ."  Just as a contract may be voidable by one 
party or by either party, so it may be enforceable by one and not by the other or it may be unenforceable by either.  Similarly, one party to an unenforceable contract may have a power to make the contract enforceable by all the usual remedies, and both voidable and unenforceable contracts may have collateral consequ ences.  Voidable contracts might be defined as one type of unenforceable 
contract.  As defined here, however, the term unenforceable contract refers to rules under which the duty of performance does not depend solely on the election of one party.  In the t ransactions here 
classified as unenforceable, some legal consequences other than the creation of a power of ratification follow without further action by either party.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A, an infant, orally accepts a written offer signed by B, an adult, to sell a tract of land.  A's promise is voidable by him because of his infancy and unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.  Upon attaining his majority, A delivers to B a signed writing stating the terms of the contract and manifesting an election to av oid it.  Under § 133, the Statute of Frauds no longer prevents 
enforcement; but the contract is avoided. 
2.  A is indebted to B, but the statute of limitations has barred a direct remedy.  A has the power to 
make direct remedies available or to make a new contract without consideration by making a new promise or part payment of the debt (see § 82).  Even without such further acts, legal consequences may flow from the barred debt.  If the creditor has security, he may have a right to apply it towards payment of the debt. b.  Types of unenforceable contracts.  Some contracts are unenforceable because they arise out of illegal bargains which are neither wholly void nor voidable.  See Comments b-d  to § 178; §§ 183 -84; 
Comment b to § 197.  Others are unenforceabl e because of laws relating primarily to remedies, such 
as the Statute of Frauds (see Chapter 5) or Statute of Limitations.  
Illustrations:  
3.  A agrees to sell specific goods to B, and B agrees to buy them.  A has previously contracted to sell the same good s to C, as B knows.  The bargain between A and B is unenforceable on grounds of 
public policy (§ 194), and neither party can enforce it while executory.  But if either party performs his promise, he can recover what he has transferred or its value.  The return promise, though 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 8  
 josh glen  Page 24 of 189 unenforceable, is given legal effect as showing that the performance was not gratuitous, and is 
therefore a contract.  
4.  A makes an oral purchase of goods from B for an agreed price of $ 500.  There is no delivery or part payment, and the bargain is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.  A insures the goods as 
owner.  The insurer cannot defeat a claim under the policy on the ground that A did not own the goods, although A would have had no direct remedy against B for failure to de liver.  
c.  Government contracts.  Contracts with a government or governmental agency are sometimes 
unenforceable under remnants of the historic English tradition that the sovereign is immune from suit.  Yet the legal consequences of such a contract show th at what is promised by the government is due as 
of right and not as a favor.  Thus, a claim against the government arising out of the contract may pass to the executor or trustee in bankruptcy of the claimant.  Sometimes such a claim, though not enforceabl e by action, may be asserted defensively in an action by the government. 
Increasingly, governments have enacted statutes giving general consent to actions on contracts.  Contracts enforceable by judicial proceedings under such statutes fall outside the present definition of unenforceable contracts, even though the action may be brought only in a special court, or relief may be limited to money damages, or execution cannot be levied on a money judgment.  The critical element is not compulsion by physical for ce, but the availability of judicial machinery to make a final 
determination of legal obligation.  Thus, where the only direct remedy is by legislative approval of a private bill or by unreviewable administrative action, the contract is within the present definition of unenforceable contracts.  
The question whether a contract is enforceable by direct legal proceedings is quite different from the question whether the legal right will be converted into money or its equivalent.  The latter question may depend on whether there is a regular practice of making appropriations to pay judgments, or, as in cases of private obligors, on the solvency of the government against whom the judgment is rendered.  There is sometimes more assurance of payment under an unenforceable contract than under a judgment. Illustrations:  
5.  A, an American citizen, holds notes issued by B, a foreign government.  Because of the sovereign immunity of B, the notes are not enforceable against B in the courts of the United States.  In an action  
by B against A on an unrelated claim, however, A may use the notes as an offset to reduce the amount of B's recovery. 
6.  A, an American citizen, has a contract with the United States government, and after a breach by the 
government obtains a judgment for damages in the United States Court of Claims.  Under the tax laws, money receivable under the contract is taxable as accrued income when there is a reasonable expectancy that the right will be converted into money.  The income accrues in the year in which the 
time for appellate review of the judgment expires, even though Congress does not appropriate money to pay the judgment until the following year.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 2 - Formation of Contracts -- Parties and 
Capacity  
 
§ 9 Parties Required   
 
There must be at least two parties to a contract, a promisor and a promisee, but there may be 
any greater number.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Promise to oneself .  In one sense a person can make a promise to himself, but the law does not 
provide remedies for breach of such promises.  This rule, which is implicit in the definition of "promise" in § 2, has been thought to be a rule of substantive law independent of mere procedural 
requirements.  But it is unlikely to have practical significance unless some other person becomes involved, and in such cases it is an unreliable basis for prediction of legal consequences.  Thus a contract may be formed in which the same person is one of several on one side of a bargain, and either alone or with others a party on the other side.  See § 11.  Again, where one party to a contract becomes both obligor and obligee and there are no other parties to the contract, the contract is not necessarily deprived of all legal consequences.  See the provisions on discharge in Chapter 12; compare Uniform Commercial Code §§ 3-208, 3-601. b.  Different capacities.  One person may have different capacities, as for instance as trustee, as 
executor , as partner, and as individual.  If he purports to make a promise in one capacity to himself in 
another capacity, there may be legal consequences.  He cannot make a contract by his own undisclosed mental processes; a contract requires a manifestation of i ntention.  Even if his intention is 
manifested by execution of a formal document or by other conduct, it may not be technically accurate to say that in one capacity he holds a claim against himself in another capacity, but that may be substantially the eff ect of his acts.  Thus if a trust company holds a sum of money in trust, and in 
accordance with the terms of the trust deposits the money in its banking department, it is under substantially the same duties to the beneficiaries as if it held a claim against a third person in trust.  See Restatement, Second, Trusts § 87; compare Restatement, Second, Agency § 24.  Such self -dealing 
by a fiduciary may involve a breach of duty to a beneficiary or principal.  See Restatement, Second, Trusts § 170; Restatement, Second, Agency § 387. c.  Multiple parties .  Under § 1 a contract may be a "set of promises", and there may be multiple 
promisors and multiple promisees in one set. Illustration: 
1.  A, B, C and D enter into a written contract by which A makes certain promises to B, other 
promises to C, and other promises to D.  In return B, C and D promise a single performance to A, or each promises A a separate performance.  In either case there is a contract, and numerous variations

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 2 - Formation of Contracts -- Parties and 
Capacity  
 
§ 10 Multiple Promisors and Promisees of the Same Performance   
 
(1)  Where there are more promisors than one in a contract, some or all of them may promise 
the same performance, whether or not there are also promises of separate performances.  
(2)  Where there are more promisees than one in a contract, a promise may be made to some or 
all of them as a unit, whether or not the same o r another performance is separately promised to 
one or more of them.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Procedural limitations at common law .  Historically it was said that there could be only two sides 
to an action at law, that of the plaintiff and that of the defendant.  There might be more than one person on each side, but it was necessary that all the parties joined as plaintiffs assert a common right and that all the persons joined as defendants be charged with a common duty.  In equity, however, there has never been a requirement that the parties to a suit must consist of merely two units, one 
seeking to enforce a right against the other.  On the contrary, any number of parties having diverse and conflicting legal relations could be dealt with under equity procedure; and the same thing is true where under modern statutes or rules of court legal and equitable procedures have been merged in a single form of action.  The extent to which remnants of common- law procedure survive in the United States 
is beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  
b.  Multiple promises; suretyship .  As a matter of substantive law, an indefinite number of persons 
may contract with one another, and there may be three or more individuals or groups, each with distinct rights and duties.  Promises may be made by individuals or by groups acting together, and 
they may be made to individuals or to groups acting together. 
Rules governing multiple promises of the same performance are stated in Chapter 13.  Where 
promises of t he same performance are made by two or more promisors, there is necessarily a relation 
of suretyship among the promisors.  Thus, if there are two promisors, either one is the principal obligor and the other his surety, or each is a principal obligor as to a part and a surety as to the balance.  Rules of suretyship are stated in the Restatement of Security; in general they are beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  
Illustration: 
1.  A promises to convey a tract of land to his three sons, B, C and D.  In return B and C promise to 
build and maintain a home for A; D promises to live with A and to support and care for him; B, C and D promise that A will receive $ 200 a year.  As to the home, B is the principal obligor for his share and C for his; B is C's surety for C's share and C is B's surety for B's share.  Similarly, as to the $ 200, 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 10  
 josh glen  Page 29 of 189 each is principal as to a third and surety for each of the others.  D alone is bound to furnish care and 
support. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is derived from form er § 16, but the terminology "joint," "several," and "joint and 
several" is avoided because of its obsolete connotations.  See 4 Corbin, Contracts §§ 923- 42 (1951 & 
Supp. 1980); cf. 2 Williston, Contracts § 336 (3d ed. 1959).  The terms are used in Chapter  13 of the 
Restatement of this Subject, particularly §§ 289, 290, 294 and 296- 300, but attention should be given 
to the Introductory and Statutory Notes to Chapter 13. Comment a .  Procedural problems at common law are discussed at length in 4 Corbin, Contr acts §§ 
925, 928- 37 (1951 & Supp. 1980); on modern statutory changes, see 2 Williston, Contracts §§ 336-
36A, 344A (3d ed. 1959), and the Statutory Note to Chapter 13. 
Comment b .  In Corbin's words, "the question whether two or more promisors have promised a single 
undivided performance, or have each promised a limited and separate performance, is wholly a problem of interpretation." 4 Corbin, Contracts § 926 at 704 (1951).  Interpretation of multiple promises is discussed in 4 id. §§ 926- 27, and in §§ 288, 297 and 301 of this Restatement.  Illustration

§ 11 When a Person May Be Both Promisor and Promisee   
 
A contract may be formed between two or more persons acting as a unit and one or more but 
fewer than all of these persons, acting either singly or with other persons.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  The Section is applicable to contracts in general, including the types enumerated in § 6.  It does not touch upon the rightfulness of making such contracts.  Self -dealing may render a contract voidable.  
As to persons acting in more than one capacity, see Comment b to § 9. Illustrations:  
1.  A becomes a member of an unincorporated society, and by so doing promises to pay dues to the society.  He is bound by a contract. 
2.  A, a trustee of an estate jointly with B, enters into a written agreement by which he individually 
promises to buy and A and B as trustees promise to sell a piece of land belonging to the trust.  This is a contract; and, thought it  is voidable by the beneficiaries if made without either their consent or the 
authority of a court, it is enforceable unless the beneficiaries elect to avoid it.  
b.  Historically contracts falling within the terms of this Section were said not to be enforc eable at 
common law, but this difficulty could be obviated by resort to a court of equity.  The extent to which this procedural distinction survives in the United States is beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 2 - Formation of  Contracts -- Parties and 
Capacity  
 
§ 12 Capacity to Contract   
 
(1)  No one can be bound by contract who has not legal capacity to incur at least voidable 
contractual duties.  Capacity to contract may be partial and its existence in respect of a particular transaction may depend upon the nature of the transaction or upon other circumstances.  
(2)  A natural person who manifests assent to a transaction has full legal capacity to incur contractual duties thereby unless he is  
(a)  under guardianship, or  
(b)  an infant, or  
(c)  mentally ill or defective, or  
(d)  intoxicated.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Total and partial incapacity .  Capacity, as here used, means the legal power which a normal person 
would have under the same circumstances.  See Restatement, Second, Agency § 20; Restatement, Second, Trusts § 18.  Incapacity may be total, as in cases where extreme physical or mental disability prevents manifestation of assent to the transaction, or in cases of mental illness after a guardian has  
been appointed.  Often, however, lack of capacity merely renders contracts voidable.  See § 7.  Incapacity sometimes relates only to particular types of transactions; on the other hand, persons whose capacity is limited in most circumstances may be bound by particular types of transactions.  In cases of partial disability, the law of mistake or of misrepresentation, duress and undue influence may be relevant.  See Chapters 6 and 7, particularly §§ 153, 157, 161(d), 163, 164, 167, 169(c) and 177, Comment b to § 172 and Comment c  to § 175. 
b.  Types of incapacity .  Historically, the principal categories of natural persons having no capacity or 
limited capacity to contract were married women, infants, and insane persons.  Those formerly referred to as insane a re included in the more modern phrase "mentally ill," and mentally defective 
persons are treated similarly.  Statutes sometimes authorize the appointment of guardians for habitual drunkards, narcotics addicts, spendthrifts, aged persons or convicts as in c ases of mental illness.  Even 
without the appointment of a guardian, civil powers of convicts may be suspended in whole or in part during imprisonment; and American Indians are for some purposes treated as wards of the United 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 12  
 josh glen  Page 32 of 189 States government.  The contractual powers of convicts and Indians are beyond the scope of the 
Restatement of this Subject.  As to convicts, see Model Penal Code § 306.5. c.  Inability to manifest assent .  In order to incur a contractual duty, a party must make a promise, 
manifesting his intention; in most cases he must manifest assent to a bargain.  See §§ 2, 17, 18.  The conduct of a party is not effective as a manifestation of his assent unless he intends to engage in the conduct.  See § 19.  Hence if physical disability prevents a p erson from acting, or if mental disability 
is so extreme that he cannot form the necessary intent, there is no contract.  Similarly, even if he intends to engage in the conduct, there is no contract if the other party knows or has reason to know that he does not intend the resulting appearance of assent.  See § 20.  In such cases it is proper to say that incapacity prevents the formation of a contract. d.  Married women .  At common law a married woman had no capacity to incur contractual duties, 
although courts of equity recognized a limited power with respect to property conveyed to her separate use.  Modern statutes in most States have given married women full power to contract, and they are therefore omitted from the list in subsection (2) of persons who may not have full capacity.  In some 
States, however, capacity is still denied with respect to particular types of contracts, such as contracts between husband and wife, contracts of suretyship, contracts for the sale of real property, or contracts relatin g to the management of community property. 
e.  Artificial persons.  The contractual powers of artificial persons such as corporations and 
governmental agencies are beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  The tendency of modern legislation is to restrict the assertion of the defense of ultra vires by business corporations, and in effect to give them full capacity; what was once lack of capacity then resembles lack of authority as used in the law of agency.  See Model Business Corporation Act § 6 (1961).  Where partnerships or unincorporated associations have no power to contract as such, contracts made in their names bind the members instead.  Compare Restatement, Second, Agency § 20; Restatement, Second, Trusts §§ 97, 98. f.  Necessaries.  Pers ons having no capacity or limited capacity to contract are often liable for 
necessaries furnished to them or to their wives or children.  Though often treated as contractual, such liabilities are quasi -contractual: the liability is measured by the value of  the necessaries rather than by 
the terms of the promise.  The rules governing such liabilities are beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  See Restatement of Restitution §§ 62, 112-17, 139.

Comment d .  Even in the absence of the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, any treatment of 
married women as having less capacity to contract than either married men or single women would appear to be of very doubtful constitutionality, as based upon either an irrational classification (see 
Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971)) , or an irrebutable presumption (see Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. 
LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 (1974)) . In fact, such treatment will probably be tested under a more rigorous 
standard, and thus is even more likely to be struck down.  See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976)

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 2 - Formation of  Contracts -- Parties and 
Capacity  
 
§ 13 Persons Affected by Guardianship   
 
A person has no capacity to incur contractual duties if his property is under guardianship by 
reason of an adjudication of mental illness or defect.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  The reason for appointing a guardian of property is to preserve the property from being 
squandered or improvidently used.  The guardianship proceedings are treated as giving public notice of the ward's incapacity and establish his status with respect to transactions during guardianship even though the other party to a particular transaction may have no knowledge or reason to know of the guardianship: the guardian is not required to give personal notice to all persons who may deal with the ward.  The control of the ward's property is vested in the guardian, subject to court supervision; that control and supervision are not to be impaired or avoided by proof that the ward has regained his reason or has had a lucid interval, unless the guardianship is terminated or abandoned. 
The rules governing contracts made by a guardian are beyond the scope of the Restatement of this 
Subject.  A contract purporting not to bind the guardian personally but to bind the ward's estate raises problems much like those raised by a similar contract made by a trustee.  See Restatement, Second, 
Trusts §§ 262, 263, 271.  But the powers of guardians are usually defined by statute, and are ordinarily much narrower than those of trustees. b.  Non -contractual obligat ions.  Property under guardianship may be reached in some circumstances 
to redress the torts of the ward or to satisfy his quasi -contractual obligations.  See Restatement of 
Restitution § 139.  The guardian is not required, in order to defend the ward agai nst contractual 
liability arising out of a transaction during guardianship, to restore the other party to his original position, since such a requirement might force the guardian to use other property to replace property dissipated by the ward.  Compare Restatement of Restitution § 62.  But the other party may be able to reclaim the consideration received by the ward if it can be found.  In some cases, as where necessaries have been furnished, the other party, to avoid unjust enrichment, may recover the fair value of the consideration received by the ward.  See Comment f  to § 12.

1.  A, under guardianship by reason of mental illness, buys an old car from B for $ 300, giving a 
promissory note for that amount.  A subsequently abandons the car.  A  is not liable on the note.  B 
may reclaim the car or, if the car is found to be a necessary, has a claim for having furnished it to A. c.  Types of guardianship.  The rule of this Section had its origin in cases of insanity.  It does not apply 
to cases wh ere a person is committed or voluntarily admitted to an asylum or hospital without the 
appointment of a guardian, or where a guardian of the person only is appointed.  In such cases the 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 13  
 josh glen  Page 35 of 189 adjudication may have evidentiary value under § 15, but there may be a  voidable contract 
notwithstanding mental illness or defect.  Nor does the rule apply to infants: parents are natural 
guardians of the person but not the property of an infant, and the appointment of a guardian of the infant's property does not prevent the infant from affirming his contract when he becomes of age. 
Unless a statute provides otherwise, the rule governing insane persons applies also to persons under 
guardianship by reason of mental illness or defect or as habitual drunkards, narcotics addicts,  
spendthrifts, aged persons or convicts.  In some states it makes no difference that the guardian is known as a committee, conservator, or curator, or by some other title, but in others, conservatorship is a less drastic procedure not conclusive and someti mes not even probative on the issue of 
incompetency.  Where a statute authorizes the appointment of a guardian on the voluntary application of the ward -to-be without any adjudication of disability, the ward may retain some capacity to 
contract, subject to subsequent judicial approval, either where the guardian consents or where the 
guardian's control of the property is not impaired. Illustration: 
2.  Shortly after commitment to a hospital for the insane and while still confined, A conveys land to B, 
taking back a purchase- money mortgage.  Subsequently C is appointed guardian of A's property.  On 
A's behalf, C ratifies the conveyance and sues to enforce the mortgage by foreclosure.  B has no defense: since A was not under guardianship, the conveyance and mortgage were voidable, not void.  See § 15. d.  Termination of guardianship.  When the reason for guardianship ceases, the guardianship should 
ordinarily be terminated by judicial decree.  But when the ward recovers from mental illness, for example, the guardianship is sometimes abandoned without any formality.  In such cases, if the guardian dies or is removed and no successor is appointed, the guardianship is no longer conclusive of contractual incapacity, and the same may be true in other cases if the ward resumes full control of his property without interference over a substantial period of time. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is new.  Allen, Ferster and Weihofen, Mental Impairment and Legal Incompetency 260-63 (1968) discusses the Tentative Draft of this Section and of § 12, and disagrees with the rule of total incapacity for those affected by guardianship.  There is always a tension between certainty and fairness when capacity is involved.  When a guardianship proceeding involves a judicial finding of incom petency, there is a stronger argument for certainty.  Compare the discussions of conservatorship 
in the Reporter's Note to Comment c , and of informal terminations of guardianships in the Reporter's 
Note to Comment d.  See also 1 Corbin, Contracts § 7 (1963); 2 Williston, Contracts § 257 (3d ed. 1959); Madden, Persons and Domestic Relations § 235 (1931); Smoot, Insanity § 349 (1929); Weihofen, Mental Incompetency to Contract or Convey, 39 So. Cal. L. Rev. 211- 15, 220- 23, 228-33,

Restatement o f the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 2 - Formation of Contracts -- Parties and 
Capacity  
 
§ 14 Infants   
 
Unless a statute provides otherwise, a natural person has the capacity to incur only voidable 
contractual duties until the beginning of the day before the person's eighteenth birthday.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Who are infants .  The common law fixed the age of twenty- one as the age at which both men and 
women achieve full capacity to contract, and the rule that the critical moment is the beginning of the preceding day was established on the ground that the law disregards fractions of a day.  In almost every State these rules have been changed by statute.  It appears that 49 States have lowered the age of majority, either gene rally or for contract capacity, to less than twenty -one; usually, the age is eighteen.  
See the table in the Reporter's Note to this Comment.  The birthday rather than the preceding day is the date of majority in some States; in some both men and women have full capacity upon marriage. b.  Obligations which are not voidable .  Infants' contracts were at one time classified as void, voidable 
or valid, but the modern rule in the absence of statute is that they are voidable by the infant.  See § 7.  Compare Res tatement, Second, Agency § 20.  An infant may be bound by obligations imposed by law 
independently of contract, such as tort and quasi -contractual obligations.  See Comment f  to § 12, 
Restatement of Restitution § 139.  In addition, certain contracts are held binding, ordinarily by statute, such as recognizances for appearance in court or contracts made with judicial approval.  Modern statutes also sometimes deny the power of disaffirmance as to such transactions as withdrawal of bank deposits or payment of life insurance premiums.  
c.  Restoration of consideration.  An infant need not take any action to disaffirm his contracts until he 
comes of age.  If sued upon the contract, he may defend on the ground of infancy without returning the consideration received .  His disaffirmance revests in the other party the title to any property 
received by the infant under the contract.  If the consideration received by the infant has been dissipated by him, the other party is without remedy unless the infant ratifies the c ontract after coming 
of age or is under some non- contractual obligation.  But some states, by statute or decision, have 
restricted the power of disaffirmance, either generally or under particular circumstances, by requiring restoration of the consideration  received.  Where the infant seeks to enforce the contract, the 
conditions of the other party's promise must be fulfilled.  The problems arising when an infant seeks to disaffirm a conveyance or executed contract are beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject, whether the disaffirmance is attempted before or after he comes of age.  As to what constitutes ratification, see § 85.

Comment a .  The impetus for the lowering of the age of majority probably came from the widespread 
draft of those under twenty- one and from the lowering of the voting age to eighteen; cf.  Oregon v. 
Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970)  and U.S. Const. Amend. XXVI.  The follow ing state statutes make the 
age of majority for purposes of contract eighteen unless another age is indicated.

price, see 2 Williston, Contracts § 238 (3d ed. 1959); Annots., 16 A.L.R. 1475 (1922), 36 A.L.R. 782 
(1925), 124 A.L.R. 1368 (1940). On the minor's liability for the use or depreciation of the property 
involved, see 2 Williston, supra § 238 and Annot., 12 A.L.R.3d 1174 (1964) . Cf. Annot., 44 A.L.R.3d 
1417 (1970)  (liability of infant's surety).  
When capacity problems raised by mental illness, mental defect and intoxication are decided, among 
the factors to be considered are the knowledge of the other party and his good faith reliance on the disabled party's apparent capacity.  Traditionally, however the infant's misrepresentation of age and the other party's reasonable reliance upon it have not been considered.  It is arguable that rather than this conceptual approach, the analysis ought to center more on the fairness of the transaction.  Compare §§ 14 and 16.  It would be possible to examine transactions involving minors by the rules of 
unconscionability and fraud, examining the transaction more closely if the minor is very young.  This, however, may be deemed too great a departure from the traditional  reluctance of courts to review the 
adequacy of consideration, although, as already noted, that appears to be the technique used with mental incapacity and intoxication.  There is also an argument for a rigid approach because this avoids a factual issue th at may lead to extensive litigation, which in turn may discourage minors from 
assertingtheir incapacity against parties better able to bear litigation costs.  Nonetheless, it seems reasonable and above all fair, to consider misrepresentations of age by the minor and the 
reasonableness of reliance on them by the other party.  The younger the minor, the less likely it would be that a court would hold the minor estopped by his misrepresentation, since the degree of the minor's social responsibility would be sm aller and since the other party's reliance would be less justifiable.  
This is especially true if eighteen is the age of majority.  This approach has been followed in a number of states in various procedural contexts, although the majority of states appear  to retain the traditional 
rule of no estoppel. 
On false representations of age generally, see 2 Williston, Contracts § 245 (3d ed. 1959); Miller, Fraudulent Misrepresentations of Age as Affecting the Infant's Contract -- A Comparative Study, 15 
U. Pitt. L . Rev. 73 (1953); Comment, 7 St. Louis U.L.J. 327 (1963). On estoppel due to 
misrepresentations of age see the above- cited authorities; Annot., 29 A.L.R.3d 1270 (1967) ; Haydocy 
Pontiac, Inc. v. Lee, 19 Ohio App.2d 217, 250 N.E.2d 898 (1969) ; Kan. Stat. Ann. § 38-103 (1973).  
Estoppel often turns on the procedural posture of the case: is the minor plaintiff or defendant; is the 
action one at law or in equity?  Authorities are grouped in various procedural categories in Annot., 29 
A.L.R.3d 1270 (1967) , supra.  Many jurisdictions that do not permit the infant to be estopped allow the 
other party to recover damages in tort for the minor's misrepresentation.  See Miller, supra, 15 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 73 (1953); Comment, 7 St. Louis U.L.J. 327, 329 (1963). Williston appears to support the distinction.  2 Williston, supra, § 245 at 67 -68; accord, Pr osser, Torts § 134 at 998 -1000 (4th ed. 1971) 
("The effect of the decisions refusing to recognize tort liability for misrepresentations [of age by minors] is to create a privileged class of liars who are a great trouble to the business world.  These decisi ons seem to rest on a failure to distinguish between a shield and a sword . . . .").  One may 
question the shield -sword distinction and argue that to refuse to permit estoppel by misrepresentation 
as a reply to the affirmative defense of infancy while perm itting a tort claim for the same 
misrepresentation is to exalt form over substance.  This analysis led a student commentator to call for the abolition of the minor's tort liability, Comment, 7 St. Louis U.L.J. 327 (1963), supra.  It seems more sensible to permit the misrepresentation to be used as well for estoppel purposes, especially since estoppel brings into play the usual requirement of good faith and reasonable reliance by the other

a rigid age requirement, see Navin, The Contracts of Minors Viewed from the Perspective of Fair Exchange, 50 N.C.L. Rev. 517 (1972). Cf. Green, Proof of Mental Incompetency and the Unexpressed Major Premise, 53 Yale L.J. 272 (1944).

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 2 - Formation of Contracts -- Parties and 
Capacity  
 
§ 15 Mental Illness or Defect   
 
(1)  A person incurs only voidable contractual duties by entering into a transaction if by reason 
of mental illness or defect  
(a)  he is unable to understand in a r easonable manner the nature and consequences of the 
transaction, or  
(b)  he is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and the other party 
has reason to know of his condition. 
(2)  Where the contract is made on fair terms and the other party is without knowledge of the 
mental illness or defect, the power of avoidance under Subsection (1) terminates to the extent that the contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the circumstances have so changed that avoidance would  be unjust.  In such a case a court may grant relief as justice 
requires.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  A contract made by a person who is mentally incompetent requires the reconciliation of 
two conflicting policies: the protection of justifiable expectations and of the security of transactions, and the protection of persons unable to protect themselves against imposition.  Each policy has sometimes prevailed to a greater extent than is stated in this Section.  At one extreme, it has been said that a lunatic has no capacity to contract because he has no mind; this view has given way to a better understanding of mental phenomena and to the doctrine that contractual obligation depends on manifestation of assent rather than on mental assent .  See §§ 2, 19.  At the other extreme, it has been 
asserted that mental incompetency has no effect on a contract unless other grounds of avoidance are present, such as fraud, undue influence, or gross inadequacy of consideration; it is now widely believed  that such a rule gives inadequate protection to the incompetent and his family, particularly 
where the contract is entirely executory.  
b.  The standard of competency .  It is now recognized that there is a wide variety of types and degrees 
of mental incompetency.  Among them are congenital deficiencies in intelligence, the mental deterioration of old age, the effects of brain damage caused by accident or organic disease, and mental illnesses evidenced by such symptoms as delusions, hallucinations, delirium, confusion and depression.  Where no guardian has been appointed, there is full contractual capacity in any case unless the mental illness or defect has affected the particular transaction: a person may be able to understand almost nothing, or only simple or routine transactions, or he may be incompetent only with 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 15  
 josh glen  Page 45 of 189 respect to a particular type of transaction.  Even though understanding is complete, he may lack the 
ability to control his acts in the way that the normal individual can and does control them; in such 
cases the inability makes the contract voidable only if the other party has reason to know of his condition.  Where a person has some understanding of a particu lar transaction which is affected by 
mental illness or defect, the controlling consideration is whether the transaction in its result is one which a reasonably competent person might have made. Illustration: 
1.  A, a school teacher, is a member of a retirement plan and has elected a lower monthly benefit in 
order to provide a benefit to her husband if she dies first.  At age 60 she suffers a "nervous breakdown," takes a leave of absence, and is treated for cerebral arteriosclerosis.  When the leave expires she applies for retirement, revokes her previous election, and elects a larger annuity with no 
death benefit.  In view of her reduced life expectancy, the change is foolhardy, and there are no other circumstances to explain the change.  She fully understan ds the plan, but by reason of mental illness is 
unable to make a decision based on the prospect of her dying before her husband.  The officers of the plan have reason to know of her condition.  Two months after the changed election she dies.  The change of election is voidable.  
c.  Proof of incompetency .  Where there has been no previous adjudication of incompetency, the 
burden of proof is on the party asserting incompetency.  Proof of irrational or unintelligent behavior is essential; almost any conduct of  the person may be relevant, as may lay and expert opinions and prior 
and subsequent adjudications of incompetency.  Age, bodily infirmity or disease, use of alcohol or drugs, and illiteracy may bolster other evidence of incompetency.  Other facts have sig nificance when 
there is mental illness or defect but some understanding: absence of independent advice, confidential or fiduciary relationship, undue influence, fraud, or secrecy; in such cases the critical fact often is departure from the normal pattern o f similar transactions, and particularly inadequacy of 
consideration. d.  Operative effect of incompetency.  Where no guardian has been appointed, the effect on executory 
contracts of incompetency by reason of mental illness or defect is very much like that of infancy.  Regardless of the other party's knowledge or good faith and regardless of the fairness of the terms, the incompetent person on regaining full capacity may affirm or disaffirm the contract, or the power to affirm or disaffirm may be exercised  on his behalf by his guardian or after his death by his personal 
representative.  There may, however, be related obligations imposed by law independently of contract which cannot be disaffirmed.  See Comment f  to § 12, Comment b to § 14.  And if the other  party did 
not know of the incompetency at the time of contracting he cannot be compelled to perform unless the contract is effectively affirmed.  
Illustration: 
2.  A, an incompetent not under guardianship, contracts to sell land to B, who does not know of the 
incompetency.  A continues to be incompetent.  On discovering the incompetency, B may refuse to perform until a guardian is appointed, and if none is appointed within a reasonable time may obtain a decree canceling the contract.  
e.  Effect of performance .  Where the contract has been performed in whole or in part, avoidance is 
permitted only on equitable terms.  In the traditional action at law, the doing of equity by or on behalf of the incompetent was accomplished by a tender before suit, but in equity or under modern merged procedure it is provided for in the decree.  Any benefits still retained by the incompetent must be restored or paid for, and restitution must be made for any necessaries furnished under the contract.  See Comment f  to § 12.  If the other party knew of the incompetency at the time of contracting, or if 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 15  
 josh glen  Page 46 of 189 he took unfair advantage of the incompetent, consideration not received by the incompetent or 
dissipated without benefit to him need not be restored. Illustrations:  
3.  A, an incompetent not under guardianship, contracts to buy land for a fair price from B, who does not know of the incompetency.  Shortly after transfer of title to A and part payment by A, A dies.  A's personal representative may recover A's part payment on reconveying the land to B. 
4.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 3, C, with knowledge of A's incompetency, 
renders legal services to A in the transaction; after learning of A's incompetency, B pays $ 500 to C pursuant to the contract.  A's personal r epresentative need not reimburse B for the payment.  
f.  When avoidance is inequitable .  If the contract is made on fair terms and the other party has no 
reason to know of the incompetency, performance in whole or in part may so change the situation that the parties cannot be restored to their previous positions or may otherwise render avoidance 
inequitable.  The contract then ceases to be voidable.  Where the other party, though acting in good faith, had reason to know of the incompetency at the time of contracting or performance, or where the equities can be partially adjusted by the decree, the court may grant or deny relief as the situation requires.  Factors to be taken into account in such cases include not only benefits conferred and received on both sides but also the extent to which avoidance will benefit the incompetent and the extent to which others who will benefit from avoidance had opportunities to prevent the situation from arising.  
Illustrations:  
5.  A, an incompetent spouse not under guardianship, mortgages land on fair terms to B, a bank which has no knowledge or reason to know of the incompetency, for a loan of $ 2,000.  At A's request the money is paid to the other spouse, C, who absconds with it.  The contract is not voidable. 
6.  A, a congenital imbecile not under guardianship, has an interest in unimproved land which is 
contingent on his surviving his father B.  A joins B and C, a cousin, in leasing the land on fair terms for 25 years to D, who has no reason to know of the incompetency.  Subsequently A assigns his interest in the rent to C in return for C's agreement to support A for life, which C duly performs.  Five years later A joins B and C in an outright sale of the land to D.  On B's death avoidance of the sale of A's interest may be  equitable if D can be assured ofrepayment of the price and of retaining 
improvements made by him after the sale; avoidance of the lease would be inequitable. 
7.  A, an incompetent not under guardianship, lives on a homestead with his mother B and brother C.  
A also holds a mortgage on a second tract of land owned by C.  To prevent foreclosure of a mortgage on the homestead, A, B and C join in borrowing money from D on a mortgage of both tracts on fair terms.  D acts in good faith but has reason to know of A's incompetency.  A dies, leaving B his sole heir.  The mortgage to D is not voidable for the benefit of B.

that the cognitive test has been supplanted by the standard of the fairness of the particular transaction, see Green, Proof of Mental Incompetency and the Unexpressed Major Premise, 53 Yale L.J. 271 (1944). 
An additional and major distinction has been made between the cognitive test and one which also considers the impact of psychosis on judgment and control of behavior even though a party understands the nature of a n "unwise and foolhardy" transaction.  This "affective" or "motivational" 
approach is found in Ortelere v. Teachers' Retirement Bd., 25 N.Y.2d 196, 303 N.Y.S.2d 362, 250 
N.E.2d 460 (1969)  (Breitel, J.), 45 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 585 (1970), 16 Wayne L. Rev. 1188 (1970), upon 
which Illustration 1 is based, and which relied in substantial part on the Tentative Draft of Subsection (1) (b).  A contract entered into during the manic phase of manic -depressive illness was invalidated 
without a finding of unfairness in the important case of Faber v. Sweet Style Mfg. Corp., 40 Misc. 2d 
212, 242 N.Y.S.2d 763 (Sup. Ct. 1963) , 39 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 356 (1964). The general approach of Faber 
was approved of by the New York Court of Appeals in Ortelere, but Faber was limited by a lower 
court in Fingerhut v. Kralyn Enterprises, 71 Misc. 2d 846, 337 N.Y.S.2d 394 (Sup. Ct. 1971) , aff'd, 40 
A.D.2d 595, 335 N.Y.S.2d 926 (1972) , to psychotic mania, in accordance with a dictum in Ortelere 
limiting relief to medically classified psychoses.  This psychosis- neurosis distinction is criticized in 
Note, 16 Wayne L. Rev. 1188, 1194- 96 (1970), and (implicitly) in Danzig, The Capability Problem in 
Contract Law 202-03 (1978). 
The Faber -Ortelere motivational approach was approved of, and the Tentative Draft of this Section

approach is criticized in Alexander & Szasz, From Contract to Status Via Psychiatry, 13 Santa Clara Law. 537 (1973), and a California court refused to follow Faber, relying, however, on the text of  a 
state statute, which the court interpreted as mandating a cognitive approach only.  See Smalley v.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 2 - Formation of  Contracts -- Parties and 
Capacity  
 
§ 16 Intoxicated Persons   
 
A person incurs only voidable contractual duties by entering into a transaction if the other party 
has reason to know that by reason of intoxication  
(a)  he is unable to understand in a reason able manner the nature and consequences of the 
transaction, or  
(b)  he is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  Compulsive alcoholism may be a form of mental illness; and when a guardian is 
appointed for the property of a habitual drunkard, his transactions are treated like those of a person under guardianship by reason of mental illness.  See §§ 13, 15.  If drunkenness is so extreme as to prevent any manifestation of assent, there is no capacity to contract.  See §§ 2, 12, 19.  It would be possible to treat voluntary intoxication as a temporary mental disorder in all cases, but voluntary intoxication not accompanied by any other disability has been thought less excusable than mental illness.  Compare Model Penal Code § 2.08 and Comment.  Hence a contract made by an intoxicated person is enforceable by the other party even though entirely executory, unless the othe r person has 
reason to know that the intoxicated person lacks capacity.  Elements of overreaching or other unfair advantage may be relevant on the issues of competency, of the other party's reason to know, and of the appropriate remedy.  Compare Comments c, e  and f  to § 15.  Use of drugs may raise similar problems. 
b.  What contracts are voidable .  The standard of competency in intoxication cases is the same as that 
in cases of mental illness.  If the intoxication is so extreme as to prevent any manifestati on of assent, 
there is no contract.  Otherwise the other party is affected only by intoxication of which he has reason to know.  A contract made by a person who is so drunk he does not know what he is doing is voidable if the other party has reason to know  of the intoxication.  Where there is some understanding of the 
transaction despite intoxication, avoidance depends on a showing that the other party induced the drunkenness or that the consideration was inadequate or that the transaction departed from the  normal 
pattern of similar transactions; if the particular transaction in its result is one which a reasonably competent person might have made, it cannot be avoided even though entirely executory. Illustrations:  
1.  A, while in a state of extreme intoxication, signs and mails a written offer on fair terms to B, who has no reason to know of the intoxication.  B accepts the offer.  A has no right to avoid the contract. 
2.  A is ill and confined to his bed.  B, knowing that the illness is incurable, plies A with intoxicating 
liquor for a week and then purports to treat him by rubbing him with oil.  While intoxicated, A 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 16  
 josh glen  Page 50 of 189 executes by mark a contract to sell land to B for a grossly inadequate consideration.  Six days later A 
dies.  A's heirs may avoid the contract. 
3.  A has been drinking heavily.  B, who has also been drinking, meets A, offers to buy A's farm for $ 
50,000, a fair price, and offers A a drink which A accepts.  In drunken exhilaration A, as a joke, writes out and signs a memorandum of agreement to se ll, gets his wife to sign it, and delivers it to B, who 
understands the transaction as a serious one.  A's intoxication is no defense to B's suit for specific performance. c.  Ratification and avoidance .  Where a contract is voidable on the ground of intoxication, the rules as 
to ratification and avoidance are much the same as in cases of misrepresentation.  See Chapter 7.  On becoming sober, the intoxicated person must act promptly to disaffirm and must offer to restore consideration received.  Such an offer may be excused, however, if the consideration has been dissipated during the period of drunkenness. Illustration: 
4.  A buys a barber shop from B for $ 650.  Shortly afterward, A, helplessly drunk and evidently not 
aware of what he is doing, sells the shop back to B for $ 200.  On recovering his senses, A cannot remember the transaction and cannot find out what happened to the $ 200.  On prompt disaffirmance, A may recover the shop without repaying the $ 200.

Comment a .  Because drunkenness has b oth voluntary and compulsive aspects, the courts have been 
ambivalent toward it as an incapacity defense.  A way of avoiding the problem is to focus on the 
conduct of the other party and the fairness of the contract.  This was the approach taken in Lucy v. 
Zehmer, 196 Va. 493, 84 S.E.2d 516 (1954) . If one party takes advantage of the other's drunkenness 
and an unfair contract is entered into, a stronger case is made under the fraud, overreaching and unconscionability concepts than under capacity concepts, because the critical factor appears to be the conduct of the sober party, rather than the inability of the drunkard.  In ext reme cases, no 
manifestation of assent may occur, but otherwise, the problem seems closer to that of persons of mild mental retardation or dull normal intelligence where extra protection should be given rather than capacity denied.  See 2 Williston, Contracts § 263 (3d ed. 1957); cf. Alexander & Szasz, From Contract to Status Via Psychiatry, 13 Santa Clara Law 573, 557-59 (1973).

for restitution of the consideration on appropriate terms.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 3 - Formation of  Contracts -- Mutual Assent  >  
Topic 1 - In General  
 
§ 17 Requirement of a Bargain   
 
(1)  Except as stated in Subsection (2), the formation of a contract requires a bargain in which 
there is a manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and a consideration.  
(2)  Whether or not there is a bargain a contract may be formed under special rules applicable to formal contracts or under the rules stated in §§ 82 -94. 
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Formal contracts .  The types of contracts listed  in § 6 are not necessarily subject to the 
requirements of manifestation of assent and consideration.  Where contracts under seal still have their common -law effect, neither manifestation of assent by the promisee nor consideration is essential.  
See §§ 95, 104(1).  Under Uniform Commercial Code § 3- 408, a negotiable instrument may be 
binding without consideration in some cases.  Under Uniform Commercial Code §§ 5- 105, 5-106, 
neither manifestation of assent by the customer or the beneficiary nor consideration is necessary to the establishment of a letter of credit.  
b.  Bargains .  Contracts of types enumerated in § 6 can be used in many of the transactions essential to 
civilized life: e.g., sale or lease of land, goods, or intangible property; the rendering of services for hire; the lending of money.  But in modern times less formal contracts are far more important.  The typical contract is a bargain, and is binding without regard to form.  The governing principle in the typical case is that bargains are enforceable unless some other principle conflicts.  This chapter and the next deal with the two essential elements of a bargain: agreement and exchange.  
c.  "Meeting of the minds ."  The element of agreement is sometimes referred to as a "meeting of the 
minds." The parties to most contracts give actual as well as apparent assent, but it is clear that a mental reservation of a party to a bargain does not impair the obligation he purports to undertake.  The phrase used here, therefore, is "manifestation of mutual a ssent," as in the definition of "agreement" in § 3.  
See also Comment b to § 2.  Topics 2-5, §§ 18- 70, explain this requirement.  
d.  "Sufficient consideration."  The element of exchange is embodied in the concept of consideration.  In some cases a promise is not binding for want of consideration, despite the presence of an element of exchange.  "Consideration" has sometimes been used to refer to the element of exchange, without regard to whether it is sufficient to make an informal promise legally binding; the consideration which 
satisfies the legal requirement has then been called "sufficient consideration." As the term "consideration" is used here, however, it refers to an element of exchange which is legally sufficient, and the word "sufficient" would therefore be redundant.  The requirement of consideration is the subject of §§ 71-81. Illustration: 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 17  
 josh glen  Page 53 of 189 1.  A owes B $ 50.  In exchange for A's payment of the debt B makes a promise.  Under the rule stated 
in § 73, B's promise is without consideration. e.  Informal contract without bargain.  There are numerous atypical cases where informal promises 
are binding though not made as part of a bargain.  In such cases it is often said that there is consideration by virtue of reliance on the promise or by virtu e of some circumstance, such as a "past 
consideration," which does not involve the element of exchange.  In this Restatement, however, "consideration" is used only to refer to the element of exchange, and contracts not involving that element are described as promises binding without consideration.  There is no requirement of agreement for such contracts.  They are the subject of §§ 82-94.

Topic 2 - Manifestation of Assent in General  
 
§ 18 Manifestation of Mutual Assent   
 
Manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange requires that each party either make a promise 
or begin or render a performance.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Manifestation of assent .  Assent to the formation of an informal contract is operative only to the 
extent that it is manifested.  Compare § 3 and Comment b to § 2.  As to the manifestation of assent by 
conduct other than words, see §§ 4 and 19.  Rules for cases where one party could reasonably draw more than one inference as to the intention of another are stated in the following sections, in connection with the scope of contractual obligations (see §§ 201, 219), and in connection with mistake 
(see § 151- 58). 
b.  Assent by promise or performance .  Where a bargain has been fully performed on one side, there is 
commonly no need to determine the moment of making of the contract or whether the performing 
party made a promise before he performed.  Those issues ordinarily become important only when a dispute arises at an earlier stage.  In the typical case such a dispute involves an exchange of promises before any performance takes place; there is an offer containing a promise and made binding by an acceptance containing a return promise.  Section 50.  The beginning or tender of performance may operate as such a return promise under § 63.  In less common cases, accep tance may be made by a 
performance under § 54, and the beginning of performance may have an intermediate effect of making the offer irrevocable under § 45. c.  Sham or jest .  Where all the parties to what would otherwise be a bargain manifest an intention that 
the transaction is not to be taken seriously, there is no such manifestation of assent to the exchange as is required by this Section.  In some cases the setting makes it clear that there is no contract, as where a business transaction is simulated on  a stage during a dramatic performance.  In other cases, there 
may be doubt as to whether there is a joke, or one of the parties may take the joke seriously.  If one party is deceived and has no reason to know of the joke the law takes the joker at his word.  Even if the deceived party had reason to know of the joke, there may be a claim for fraud or unjust enrichment by virtue of the promise made.  Where the parties to a sham transaction intend to deceive third parties, considerations of public policy may sometimes preclude a defense of sham.  Cf. Illustration 1 to § 21. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is new; compare former § 20.  See 1 Williston, Contracts § 22 (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts § 107 (1963 & Supp. 1980).  The requirement of a voluntary act  is dealt with in § 19.  The 
effect of a manifestation of assent when the party does not in fact assent is stated in §§ 19, 20, and subsequent sections.  Intention to be or not to be legally bound is the subject of § 21.

Topic 2 - Manifestation of Assent in General  
 
§ 19 Conduct as Manifestation of Assent   
 
(1)  The manifestation of assent may be made wholly or partly by written or spoken words or by 
other acts or by failure to act.  
(2)  The  conduct of a party is not effective as a manifestation of his assent unless he intends to 
engage in the conduct and knows or has reason to know that the other party may infer from his conduct that he assents.  
(3)  The conduct of a party may manifest assen t even though he does not in fact assent.  In such 
cases a resulting contract may be voidable because of fraud, duress, mistake, or other invalidating cause. 
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Conduct other than words .  Words are not the only medium of expression.  Conduct may often 
convey as clearly as words a promise or an assent to a proposed promise.  See Comment a to § 4 and 
Illustrations.  Where no particular requirement of form is made by the law a condition of the validity or enforceability of a contract, there is no distinction in the effect of the promise whether it is expressed in writing, or orally, or in acts, or partly in one of these ways and partly in others.  Purely negative conduct is sometimes, though not usually, a sufficient manifestation of assent.  See § 69. 
Like words, non- verbal conduct often has different meanings to different people.  Indeed, the meaning 
of conduct not used as a conventional symbol is more uncertain and more dependent on its se tting than 
are words.  A wide variety of elements of the total situation may be relevant to the interpretation of 
such conduct.  The problem is illustrated in cases of claims against a decedent's estate for services rendered.  In such cases the line between a contractual claim based on agreement and a quasi-contractual claim based on unjust enrichment is often indistinct; on either basis a major question may be whether the services were rendered gratuitously, and the circumstances are often critical.  
Illust ration:  
1.  A lives in B's home and renders services to B over a period of years, and after B's death claims the value of the services.  By statute A is incompetent to testify to transactions with B, and there is no evidence of a verbal promise.  Among the  factors relevant to a determination whether the services 
were gratuitous are the following: a request by B that A render the services, the relation between A and B, the value of the services to B, the alternatives foregone and hardship suffered by A, the financial circumstances of the parties, the relation between B and his legatees or distributees, and their connection with A's services.  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 19  
 josh glen  Page 58 of 189 b.  "Reason to know ."  A person has reason to know a fact, present or future, if he has information 
from which a person of ordinary intelligence would infer that the fact in question does or will exist.  A 
person of superior intelligence has reason to know a fact if he has information from which a person of 
his intelligence would draw the inference.  There is also reason t o know if the inference would be 
thatthere is such a substantial chance of the existence of the fact that, if exercising reasonable care with reference to the matter in question, the person would predicate his action upon the assumption of its possible exi stence.  
Reason to know is to be distinguished from knowledge and from "should know." Knowledge means conscious belief in the truth of a fact; reason to know need not be conscious.  "Should know" imports a duty to others to ascertain facts; thewords " reason to know" are used both where the actor has a duty 
to another and where he would not be acting adequately in the protection of his own interests were he not acting with reference to the facts which he has reason to know.  See Restatement, Second, Agency § 9; Restatement, Second, Torts § 12; Uniform Commercial Code § 1-201(25). c.  Responsibility for unintended appearance of assent .  A "manifestation" of assent is not a mere 
appearance; the party must in some way be responsible for the appearance.  There must be conduct and a conscious will to engage in that conduct.  Thus, when a party is used as a mere mechanical instrument, his apparent assent does not affect his contractual relations.  See the rules on duress in §§ 174-77.  This is true even though the other party reasonably believes that the assent is genuine. 
Similarly, even though the intentional conduct of a party creates an appearance of assent on his part, 
he is not responsible for that appearance unless he knows or has reason to know that his conduct may cause the other party to understand that he assents.  In effect there must be either intentional or negligent creation of an appearance of assent.  Compare § 20 and the rules on mistake, misrepresentation, duress and undue influence in Chapters  6 and 7.  The other party must also 
manifest assent, but no further change of position on his part is necessary to the formation of a bargain.  Change of position may of course be relevant to the existence of a power of avoidance, but the law must take account of the fact that in a society largely founded on credit bargains will be relied on in subtle ways, difficult or incapable of proof. Illustrations:  
2.  A offers to sell B his library at a stated price, forgetting that his favorite Shakespeare, which he did not intend to sell, is in the library.  B accepts the offer.  There is a contract including the Shakespeare, unless B knows or has reason to know of A's temporary forgetfulness.  Whether the contract is voidable for mistake depends on the rules stated in Chapter 6. 
3.  A writes an offer to B, which he encloses in an envelope, addresses and stamps.  Shortly 
afterwards, he decides not to send the offer, but by mistake he deposits it in the mail.  It is delivered to B, who accepts the offer.  There is a contract unless B knows or has reason to know of A's error.  Whether the contract is voidable for mistake is governed by the rules stated in Chapter 6. d.  Voidable manifestations distinguished.  Actual mental assent is not essential to the formation of an  
informal contract enforceable as a bargain.  This is made clear by the definitions of "bargain" and "agreement" in terms of "manifestation" of mutual assent.  See §§ 3, 17, 18; compare Comment b  to § 
2.  But the fact that apparent assent is not genuine may have legal significance in rendering the contract voidable or unenforceable for mistake, misrepresentation, duress, or undue influence.  See Chapters 6 and 7.  In such cases it is often necessary to inquire whether the power of avoidance has been exercis ed with sufficient promptness, or whether the other party has so changed his position that 
avoidance would be inequitable.  Where there is no manifestation of mutual assent, on the other hand, the contractual relations of the parties are not affected, and such inquiries are unnecessary. 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 19  
 josh glen  Page 59 of 189 REPORTER'S NOTES  
Subsection (1) is based on former § 21.  Subsections (2) and (3) are new but are derived in part from 
former § 20 and Comment a thereto.  See generally, 1 Williston, Contracts §§ 21 -23, (3d ed. 1957); 1 
Corb in, Contracts § 62 at n.35 (1963). 
Comment a .  The distinctions between an actual agreement inferred from the parties' conduct and a 
quasi- contract implied as a matter of law to avoid unjust enrichment are nicely made in Baltimore & 
O. R.R. v. United States, 261 U.S. 592 (1923) ; and Bailey v. West, 105 R.I. 61, 249 A.2d 414 (1969) . 
See also Comment b to § 4.  Much confusion could be avoided if "imply" were not used when "infer" 
is meant.  Corbin makes this point in his chapter entitled "Interpreta tion -- The Process Called 
Implication," 3 Corbin, Contracts, ch. 25 and §§ 534 and 561 (1960 & Supp. 1980); see also 1 Williston, Contracts § 36A (3d ed. 1957); but even Corbin and Williston use the familiar term "implied in fact" for actual contracts inf erred from facts.  Perhaps it is too late to abandon so common 
a term, but its use blurs an important distinction.  For an example, see Steva v. Steva, 332 S.W.2d 924 
(Mo. 1960) . 
The issue of assent partly by conduct and partly by words may come up when negotiations are 
inconclusive, but the parties continue to deal with one another.  See, e.g., Thomson v. United States, 
357 F.2d 683 (Ct. Cl. 1966) ; and § 22, Comment b.  On inference of assent from conduct, see 1 
Williston, Contracts §§ 22A, 36 and 36A (3d ed. 1957); 3 Corbin, Contracts § 566 (1960).

§ 20 Effect of Misunderstanding   
 
(1)  There is no manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange if the parties attach materially 
different meanings to their manifestations and  
(a)  neither party knows or has reason to know the meaning attached by the other; or  
(b)  each party knows or each party has reason to know the meaning attac hed by the other.  
(2)  The manifestations of the parties are operative in accordance with the meaning attached to them by one of the parties if  
(a)  that party does not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knows the meaning at tached by the first party; or  
(b)  that party has no reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the 
other has reason to know the meaning attached by the first party.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Scope .  Subsection (1) states the implications of the rule of § 19(2) as to the meaning of 
"manifestation of mutual assent" in cases of mistake in the expression of assent.  The subject- matter of 
this Section is more fully treated in Chapter 9 on the scope of contractual obligations .  Rules are stated 
here only for two- party transactions; multi- party transactions are more complex, but are governed by 
the same principles.  As to the meaning of "reason to know," see Comment b to § 19. b.  The need for interpretation.  The meaning given to words or other conduct depends to a varying 
extent on the context and on the prior experience of the parties.  Almost never are all the connotations of a bargain exactly identical for both parties; it is enough that there is a core of common meaning sufficient to determine their performances with reasonable certainty or to give a reasonably certain 
basis for an appropriate legal remedy.  See § 33.  But material differences of meaning are a standard cause of contract disputes, and the decision of such di sputes necessarily requires interpretation of the 
language and other conduct of the parties in the light of the circumstances. c.  Interpretation and agreement .  There is a problem of interpretation in determining whether a 
contract has been made as well as in determining what obligations a contract imposes.  Where one party makes a precise and detailed offer and the other accepts it, or where both parties sign the same written agreement, there may be an "integrated" agreement (see § 209) and the problem is  then one of 
interpreting the offer or written agreement.  In other cases agreement may be found in a jumble of letters, telegrams, acts and spoken words.  In either type of case, the parties may have different 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 20  
 josh glen  Page 62 of 189 understandings, intentions and meanings.  Eve n though the parties manifest mutual assent to the same 
words of agreement, there may be no contract because of a material difference of understanding as to 
the terms of the exchange.  Where there is no integration, the parties may also differ as to whether there was an offer of any kind, or whether there was an acceptance.  Rules of interpretation governing various situations are stated in Chapter 9 on the scope of contractual obligations; those rules are applicable in the determination of what each party "knows or has reason to know." d.  Error in expression .  The basic principle governing material misunderstanding is stated in 
Subsection (1): no contract is formed if neither party is at fault or if both parties are equally at fault.  Subsection (2) deals with cases where both parties are not equally at fault.  If one party knows the other's meaning and manifests assent intending to insist on a different meaning, he may be guilty of misrepresentation.  Whether or not there is such misrepresentation as would  give the other party a 
power of avoidance, there is a contract under Subsection (2) (a), and the mere negligence of the other party is immaterial.  See § 166 as to reformation of a written contract in such a case.  Under Subsection (2) (b) a party may be bound by a merely negligent manifestation of assent, if the other party is not negligent.  The question whether such a contract is voidable for mistake is dealt with in §§ 151-58. Illustrations:  
1.  A offers to sell B goods shipped from Bombay ex steamer "Peerless".  B accepts.  There are two steamers of the name "Peerless", sailing from Bombay at materially different times.  If both parties intend the same Peerless, there is a contract, and it is immaterial whether they know or have reason to know that tw o ships are named Peerless.  
2.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, A means Peerless No. 1 and B means Peerless No. 2.  If neither A nor B knows or has reason to know that they mean different ships, or if they both know or if they both have reason to know, there is no contract. 
3.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, A knows that B means Peerless No. 2 and B 
does not know that there are two ships named Peerless.  There is a contract for the sale of the goods from Peerle ss No. 2, and it is immaterial whether B has reason to know that A means Peerless No. 1.  
If A makes the contract with the undisclosed intention of not performing it, it is voidable by B for misrepresentation (see §§ 159- 64).  Conversely, if B knows that A  means Peerless No. 1 and A does 
not know that there are two ships named Peerless, there is a contract for the sale of the goods from Peerless No. 1, and it is immaterial whether A has reason to know that B means Peerless No. 2,but the contract may be voidable by A for misrepresentation.  
4.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, neither party knows that there are two ships Peerless.  A has reason to know that B means Peerless No. 2 and B has no reason to know that A means Peerless No. 1.  T here is a contract for the sale of goods from Peerless No. 2.  In the converse 
case, where B has reason to know and A does not, there is a contract for sale from Peerless No. 1.  In either case the question whether the contract is voidable for mistake is g overned by the rules stated in 
§§ 151-58. 
5.  A says to B, "I offer to sell you my horse for $ 100." B, knowing that A intends to offer to sell his 
cow for that price, not his horse, and that the word "horse" is a slip of the tongue, replies, "I accept." The price is a fair one for either the horse or the cow.  There is a contract for the sale of the cow and 
not of the horse.  If B makes the contract with the undisclosed intention of not performing it, it is voidable by A for misrepresentation.  See §§ 159-64. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 20  
 josh glen  Page 63 of 189 This Section is based on former § 71.  See 1 Williston, Contracts §§ 94 -95 (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, 
Contracts § 104 (1963 & Supp. 1980), 3 id. § 599 (1960 & Supp. 1980); Palmer, The Effect of

Comments b and c .  See 3 Corbin, Contracts §§ 532- 39 (1960 & Supp. 1980).  It is important to 
distinguish between the common problem of interpretation of key terms of a contract and the much less common question whether a material difference of understanding has prevented the manifestation 
of mutual assent necessary to create a contract at all.  Compare Iowa -Des Moines Nat'l Bank v. 
Insurance Co. of North America, 459 F.2d 650 (8th Cir. 1972) , with Oswald v. Allen, 417 F.2d 43 (2d 
Cir. 1969) . See also 3 Corbin § 599 (1960 & Supp. 1980). 
Comment d .  Illustrations 1 -4 are  based on Illustration 1 to former § 71; that Illustration is based on 
Raffles v. Wichelhaus, 2 Hurl. & C. 906, 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864); see also Kyle v. Kavanagh, 
103 Mass. 356 (1869) . Because the Raffles report is notoriously cryptic, the extent of its holding, 
which appears to be closest to Illustration 2, has been much debated.  Some of the commentaries may be found in Holmes, The Common Law 242 (1881, Howe ed. 1963); Holmes, The Theory of Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417 (1899); 1 Williston, Contracts § 95 at 346 n.3 (3d ed. 1957); 3 Corbin, Contracts § 599 (1960 & Supp. 1980); Young, Equivocation in the Making of Agreements, 64 Colum. L. Rev. 619 (1964); Gilmore, The Death of Contract 35- 44 (1974).  Many other authorities 
relating to the subject matter of this Section are cited in the Young article.  
There has been much debate over the extent of the circumstances in which a mutual misunderstanding should prevent the formation of a contract.  Some of the circumstances proposed are: only when the name of a particular thing is misunderstood, Holmes, supra, 12 Harv. L. Rev. at 418- 19; "roughly 
speaking," when the misunderstanding has its source "in the ambivalence or 'double meaning' [as 
opposed to the inherent vagueness] of an expression," Young, supra, 64 Colum. L. Rev. at 646; and whenever the misunderstood term is "vital enough to justify upsetting the entire a rrangement," Palmer, 
supra, 65 Mich. L. Rev. at 57 n.77 (semble).  See also Gilmore, supra, 123 n.99.  While Young's distinction between ambiguity (or equivocation) and vagueness has been criticized as much too sharp by Palmer, and his reading of Raffles a s too narrow by Gilmore, it is submitted that it states a 
workable rule, especially if read in light of Young's own disclaimers of a bright line between equivocation and vagueness.  If a term is so vague that the court cannot interpret it, the court should  
decide enforceability as an issue of the requirement of reasonable certainty in contracts.  See Comment b to this Section and §§ 33 and 34; cf. Palmer, supra, at 57- 58.  A contract should be held 
nonexistent under this Section only when the misunderstanding goes to conflicting and irreconcilable 
meanings of a material term that could have either but not both meanings.  In National By -Prods., Inc. 
v. United States, 405 F.2d 1256 (Ct. Cl. 1969) , the issue was whether a document signed by one party, 
when read together with a separate agreement and oral negotiations, had created an additional contract by the United States to construct a levee on the right bank of a creek which later flooded.  The Court of Claims, in finding no additional contract, cited the Tentative Drafts of both this Section and § 2, but appears to have decided the question on the ground of lack of certainty. 
Illustration 5 is based upon Illustration 2 former § 71.  The Comment in former § 71 concluded that there was no contract for either the cow or the horse; the conclusion here is based upon Subsection (2), which holds B to his knowledge that A means the cow.  This rule is criticized by Palmer, supra, 65 
Mich. L. Rev. at 47- 56.  If the price is excessive for the cow, the court may refuse to enforce the

§ 21 Intention to Be Legally Bound   
 
Neither real nor apparent intention that a promise be legally binding is essential to the 
formation of a contract, but a manifestation of intention that a promise shall not affect legal relations may prevent the formation of a contract.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Intent to be legally bound.  Most persons are now aware of the existence of courts and rules oflaw and of the fact that some promises are binding.  The parties to a transaction often have a reasonably accurate understanding of the applicable law, and an intention to affect legal relations.  Such facts may be important in interpreting their manifestations of intention and in determining legal consequences, but they are not essential to the formation of a contract.  The parties are often quite mistaken about particular rules of law, but such mistakes do not necessarily deprive their acts of legal effect.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A  draws a check for $ 300 payable to B and delivers it to B in return for an old silver watch worth 
about $ 15.  Both A and B understand the transaction as a frolic and a banter, but each believes that he would be legally bound if the other dishonestly so a sserted.  There is no contract.  
2.  A orally promises to sell B a book in return for B's promise to pay $ 5.  A and B both think such promises are not binding unless in writing.  Nevertheless there is a contract, unless one of them intends not to be legally bound and the other knows or has reason to know of that intention. b.  Agreement not to be legally bound.  Parties to what would otherwise be a bargain and a contract sometimes agree that their legal relations are not to be affected.  In the absence of any invalidating cause, such a term is respected by the law like any other term, but such an agreement may present difficult questions of interpretation: it may mean that no bargain has been reached, or that a particular manifestation of intention is not a promise; it may reserve a power to revoke or terminate a promise under certain circumstances but not others.  In a written document prepared by one party it may raise a question of misrepresentation or mistake or overreaching; to avoid such questions it may be read against the party who prepared it. 
The parties to such an agreement may intend to deny legal effect to their subsequent acts.  But where a 
bargain has been fully or partly performed on one side, a failure to perform on the other side may result i n unjust enrichment, and the term may then be unenforceable as a provision for a penalty or 
forfeiture.  See §§ 185, 229, 356.  In other cases the term may be unenforceable as against public policy because it unreasonably limits recourse to the courts or as unconscionably limiting the remedies for breach of contract.  See §§ 178- 79, 208; Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2- 302, 2- 719 and

3.  A, an employer, issues to B, an employee, a "certificate of benefit", promising stated sums 
increasing yearly, payable to a named beneficiary if B dies while still in A's employ.  The certificate provides that it "constitutes no contract" and "confers no legal right." The quoted language may be read as reserving a power of revocation only until B dies.  
4.  A and B, two business corporations, have a contract by which B is the exclusive distributor in a certain territory of goods made by A.  By a detailed written agreement they agree to continue the distributorship for three years.  The writing prov ides that it is not to be a legal agreement or subject to 
legal jurisdiction in the law courts.  The written agreement may be read and given effect to terminate the prior contract and to prevent any legal duty arising from the making of the agreement or fr om the 
acceptance of orders under it; but it does not excuse B from paying for goods delivered under it. c.  Social engagements and domestic arrangements .  In some situations the normal understanding is 
that no legal obligation arises, and some unusual manifestation of intention is necessary to create a contract.  Traditional examples are social engagements and agreements within a family group.  See §§ 189-91.  Where the family relation is not close, valuable services rendered in the home may make 
binding an express or implied promise to pay for the services; but even in such cases it would often be understood that there is no legal obligation while the agreement is entirely executory on both sides.  See Comment a to § 19, Comment b to § 32. Illustrations:  
5.  A invites his friend B to dinner in his home, and B accepts.  There is no contract.  If A promised B a fee for attending and entertaining other guests, and B did so, there would be a contract to pay the fee. 
6.  A, a husband, is living in harmony with his wife, B.  Before A leaves on a trip, A and B assess B's 
financial needs and agree that A will remit a fixed sum per month to support her.  There is no contract. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is new; compare former § 20.  See 1 Williston, Contracts § 21 (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts § 34 (1963). 
Comment a .  See Sulzbach v. Town of Jefferson, 83 S.D. 156, 155 N.W.2d 921 (1968) ; Wyoming Farm 
Bureau v. Smith, 259 F. Supp. 870, 873 (D. Mont. 1966) , aff'd, 377 F.2d 918 (9th Cir. 1967) ; Bailey v. 
West, 105 R.I. 61, 249 A.2d 414 (1969) . The relationship of this Section to §§ 18- 20 is illustrated by 
Sulzbach v. Town of Jefferson, supra , in which a third party testified that the defendant said to him: 
"would I contract [the plaintiffs] and ask if they would take care of the work for him." This was held to be a sufficient manifestation of assent to constitute an  offer that could be (and was) accepted by 
plaintiffs' performance without notice of acceptance, and regardless of whether defendant was "conscious of the legal relationship which [his] words or acts [gave] rise to." Illustration 1 is based on 
Keller v. Holderman, 11 Mich. 248, 83 Am. Dec. 737 (1863) ; see also Kilpatrick Bros. v. International

cases of death benefits.  Illustration 4 is based on Rose & Frank Co. v. J. R. Crompton & Bros., [1923] 2 K.B. 261 (C.A.).  As Comment b indica tes, most of the arguments against enforcing a "not binding"

disputes, see discussion of Illustration 3; cf.  42 A.L.R.2d 461 (1955) . It is less strong in business 
transactions involving parties of roughly equal bargaining power, but in one such case a court found a 
duty to bargain in good faith despite language in a letter of intent that "[i]f the parties fail to agree . . . they shall be under no obligation to one another." Itek Corp. v. Chicago Aerial Indus., 248 A.2d 625

Topic 2 - Manifestation of Assent in General  
 
§ 22 Mode of Assent: Offer and Acceptance   
 
(1)  The manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange ordinarily takes the form of an offer or 
proposal by one party followed by an acceptance by the other party or parties.  
(2)  A manifestation of mutual assent may be made even though neither offer nor acceptance can be identified and even though the moment of formation cannot be determined.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  The usual practice .  Subsection (1) states the usual practice in the making of bargains.  One party 
ordinarily first announces what he will do and what he requires in exchange, and the other then agrees.  Where there are more than two parties, the second party  to agree may be regarded as accepting the 
offer made by the first party and as making a similar offer to subsequent parties, and so on.  It is theoretically possible for a third person to state a suggested contract to the parties and for them to say simul taneously that they assent.  Or two parties may sign separate duplicates of the same agreement, 
each manifesting assent whether the other signs before or after him.  Compare Illustration 5 to § 23. b.  Assent by course of conduct .  Problems of offer and acceptance are important primarily in cases 
where advance commitment serves to shift a risk from one party to the other, as in sales of goods which are subject to rapid price fluctuations, in sales of land, and in insurance contracts.  Controversies as to whether and when the commitment is made are less likely to be important even in such cases once performance is well under way.  Offer and acceptance become still less important after there have been repeated occasions for performance by one party where the o ther knows the 
nature of the performance and has an opportunity for objection to it.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-208 (1); compare Comment a to § 19.  In such cases it is unnecessary to determine the moment of 
making of the contract, or which party made the offer and which the acceptance.  Thus, Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2 -204 and 2- 207(3), relating to contracts for the sale of goods, provide that 
conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish it although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract.  The principle has also been applied in non- sales contexts.  
Illustration: 
1.  A, a general contractor preparing a bid on a government construction contract, receives a bid by a 
proposed subcontractor, B, in a given amount.  A names B as a subcontractor in A's bid, but after A receives the government contract, A unsuccessfully asks B to reduce its bid, and also unsuccessfully seeks permission from the Government to replace B as a subcontrac tor. 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 22  
 josh glen  Page 69 of 189 Pursuant to A's instructions, B proceeds with the work, but refuses to accept a work order from A 
which recites that A is still seeking permission to replace B.  No new work order is issued.  A does issue "change orders" using B's bid as the base "con tract amount." B completes the job, but A refuses 
to pay the full amount, contending that B is entitled only to restitutionary damages because there never was a contract.  There is an enforceable contract based upon A's assent to B's bid, as manifested by A's conduct, and B is entitled to the amount it bid, as modified by the change orders.

Topic 2 - Manifestation of Assent in General  
 
§ 23 Necessity That Manifestations Have Reference to Each Other   
 
It is essential to a bargain that each party manifest assent with reference to the manifestation of 
the other.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Mutuality of assent .  Two manifestations of willingness to make a bargain, though having the same 
terms, do not constitute a bargain unless each is made with reference to the other.  Ordinarily one party, by making an offer, assents in advance; the other, upon learning of the offer, assents by 
accepting it and thereby forms the contract.  The offer may be communicated directly or through an agent; but information received by one party that another is willing to enter into a bargain is not necessarily an offer.  The test is whether the offer is so made as to justify the accepting party in a belief that the offer is made to him.  
Illustration: 
1.  A advertises in a large New York newspaper that he will pay a specified reward to anyone who will 
give him certain information within one year.  B sees a copy of this advertisement in a Tokyo newspaper, correctly translated into Japanese, and sends A the information within the year.  There is a contract.  
b.  Unintended appearance of mutual assent .  Either the offeror or the offeree may be bound by an 
unintended appearance of assent created by his intentional conduct.  See § 19.  The mutual reference required by this Section is ordinarily intended by both parties to a contract, but if one party believes that there is such reference and the other knows that his conduct creates that appearance, the requirement is satisfied.  Similarly, if one party believes that there is such reference and has no reason to know that the other has a dif ferent understanding, the requirement is satisfied if the other has reason 
to know that his conduct creates the unintended appearance.  Section 20.  Thus where an offer is contained in a writing either the offeror or the offeree may, without reading the writing, manifest assent to it and bind himself without knowing its terms.  Again, where goods are sent by a seller as an offer to a buyer, the buyer, without examining them or knowing precisely what they are or that a bargain is proposed, can bind himself by accepting the goods.  So in many cases usages of business or of local exchanges are annexed as terms to an offer, and an offeror or offeree who should be aware of those terms may be bound in accordance with them if he manifests assent.  See §§ 219 -23; Uniform 
Commercial Code §§ 1-205, 2-104. c.  Unknown offers of rewards .  Obligations arising from unintended manifestations of assent by an 
offeree are imposed in order to protect the offeror in justifiable reliance on the offeree's promise.  If the offer cl early contemplates no commitment by the offeree, so that no binding return promise can be 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 23  
 josh glen  Page 71 of 189 made and justifiable reliance by the offeror is impossible, this reason disappears.  Thus if a general 
offer of reward to anyone who does a certain act or achieves a certain result is treated as contemplating a bargain, the only expectations to be fulfilled are those of the offeree, and he may have none unless he knows of the offer. 
Such an offer is commonly interpreted as intended to induce action by people who know of the 
reward.  A person who acts without such knowledge is then not within the terms of the offer, even though he intends to accept any offer which may be outstanding and thus does not act gratuitously.  Standing offers of rewards made by governmental bodi es, however, may be regarded as intended to 
create a climate in which people do certain acts in the hope of earning unknown rewards.  Theoretically, an act so done might create a bargain, but recovery of the reward can be justified just as well by treating  the offer as a promise binding without mutual assent or consideration or as creating a 
non-contractual obligation. Illustrations:  
2.  A advertises that he will give a specified reward for certain information, or writes B a similar proposal.  B gives the information in ignorance of the advertisement, or without having received the letter.  There is no contract enforceable as a bargain.  
3.  A city ordinance provides that a standing reward of $ 1000 will be paid for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of arson within the city limits.  A furnishes such information.  A is entitled to the reward whether or not he knew of the reward or was motivated by hope of reward. d.  Cross offers.  Cases have occurred in which identical offers have crossed in the mails.  Such an event is unusual, and the ordinary offer does not manifest assent to the formation of a contract in this way.  Hence, neither offer accepts the other, and there is no contract unless one of the parties accepts the offer he  has received.  This is a matter of interpretation; theoretically, just as the offeror may 
assent in advance to an acceptance, so each of two offerors could assent in advance to a cross- offer.  
Such assent is rare, but it may be inferred where both parties  think a contract has already been made.  
The use of a cross-offer to assist in the interpretation of a previous offer should be distinguished. Illustrations:  
4.  A sends B an offer through the mail to sell A's horse for $ 500.  While this offer is in the mail, B, in ignorance thereof, mails to A an offer to pay $ 500 for the horse.  There is no contract. 
5.  After negotiations through a broker, A writes B a letter purporting to confirm a contract for the sale 
of cloth.  A's letter crosses in the mail a similar letter from B, which differs as to quantity and time of payment.  A replies insisting on the quantity stated in his first letter but otherwise agreeing; B replies insisting on the time of payment stated in his first letter but otherwise agreeing.  The  two replies cross 
in the mail.  There is a contract.  
6.  A offers by letter to sell goods to B, stating no definite time limit for acceptance.  B accepts by letter after what might or might not be more than a reasonable time.  The acceptance crosses a let ter 
from A stating that he has not heard from B and that A's offer will terminate if B does not reply by return mail.  There is a contract.  
e.  Acceptance of unknown terms .  An offeree, knowing that an offer has been made to him, need not 
know all its term s.  Knowing that an offer has been made, he can accept without investigation of the 
exact terms, either intentionally or by words or conduct creating an unintended appearance of intention to accept.  The governing principles are the same as those for unrecognized offers, explained in Comment b.

7.  A sends to B an offer to sell a specified lot for $ 5,000, also stating terms as to time of payment, 
mortgage security, taxes and insurance.  B is so anxious to buy the lot that, without reading any of 
these additional terms, he sends to A an unconditional acceptance.  There is a contract on the terms stated in A's offer.

1955) ; Broadnax v. Ledbetter, 100 Tex. 375, 99 S.W. 1111 (1907) ; there  is a minority view that does 
not require knowledge of the reward by the claimant at the time the requested services are performed.  See Annot., 53 A.L.R. 542 (1928). Illustration 3 is based on Choice v. City of Dallas, 210 S.W. 753 
(Tex. Civ. App. 1919) . In State v. Malm, 143 Conn. 462, 123 A.2d 276 (1956) , a statute permitted the 
Governor to offer specific rewards; plaintiff , who communicated key information before the reward 
was announced, was not permitted to recover.  The Malm opinion cites authorities both ways on whether rewards offered by government agencies should be analyzed by the rules governing contract formation. 
Comment d .  Illustration 4 is based on Illustration 2 to former § 23.  Illustration 5 is based on Morris 
Asinof & Sons v. Freudenthal, 195 A.D. 79, 186 N.Y.S. 383 (1921) , aff'd mem., 233 N.Y. 564, 135 N.E. 
919 (1922) . Illustration 6 is based on Mactier's Adm'rs v. Frith, 6 Wend. 102, 21 Am. Dec. 262 (N.Y. 
1830) . 
Comment e .  On Illustration 7, see 1 Williston, Contracts § 35 (3d ed. 1957), where the basic rule is 
stated.  The rationale is that the offeree has led the offeror to believe that the offeree assents to the terms of the offer.  However, many exceptions to the rule exist.  For extensive discussions of the "duty" to read, see Calamari, Duty to Read -- A Changing Concept, 43 Ford. L. Rev. 341 (1974); 
Calamari and Perillo, Contracts, §§ 9 -41 to 9- 46 (2d ed. 1977) (based on preceding article); Macaulay, 
Private Legislation and the Duty to Read -- Business Run by IB M Machine, the Law of Contracts and 
Credit Cards, 19 Vand. L. Rev. 1051 (1966). In Hohfeldian terms, the "duty" to read is really the absence of a right to be excused because one failed to read the terms of an offer.  In assessing the rule, one must balance against the rationale mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph considerations of fairness such as the legibility and prominence of the provision, possible misrepresentation or overreaching by one party in describing the document to the other and the relative bargaining power of the parties.  See §§ 205, 208, and 211. 
Even among merchants, courts have refused to enforce "inconspicuous" terms because of lack of 
"knowing" consent, particularly, it would seem, with respect to arbitration clauses.  See, e.g., Windsor 
Mills v. Collins & Aikman Corp., 25 Cal. App.3d 987, 101 Cal. Rptr. 347 (1972)  and authorities cited 
there; con tra: Joseph Wilmotte & Co. v. Rosenman Bros., 258 N.W.2d 317 (Iowa 1977) . It is possible 
that these decisions are attributa ble to a reluctance to permit the right of access to courts to be waived 
inadvertently.  This would give them less importance as matters of general contract law.  Where a consumer has agreed to a contract of adhesion, there is even greater reason to scruti nize the assent 
allegedly involved.  See § 211(3) and Comments.

Topic 3 - Making of Offers  
 
§ 24 Offer Defined   
 
An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a barg ain, so made as to justify another 
person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Offer as promise.  An offer may propose an executed sale or barter rather than a contract, or  it may 
propose the exchange of a promise for a performance or an exchange of promises, or it may propose 
two or more such transactions in combination or in the alternative.  In the normal case of an offer of an exchange of promises, or in the case of an offer of a promise for an act, the offer itself is a promise, revocable until accepted.  There may also be an offer of a performance, to be exchanged either for a return promise (§ 55) or for a return performance; in such cases the offer is not necessarily a promise, 
but there are often warranties or other incidental promises.  
Illustration: 
1.  A says to B, "That book you are holding is yours if you promise to pay me $ 5 for it." This is an 
offer empowering B, by making the requested promise, to make himself  owner of the book and thus 
complete A's performance.  In that event there is also an implied warranty of title made by A.  See Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2-312, 2-401. b.  Proposal of contingent gift .  A proposal of a gift is not an offer within the prese nt definition; there 
must be an element of exchange.  Whether or not a proposal is a promise, it is not an offer unless it specifies a promise or performance by the offeree as the price or consideration to be given by him.  It is not enough that there is a promise performable on a certain contingency. Illustration: 
2.  A promises B $ 100 if B goes to college.  If the circumstances give B reason to know that A is not 
undertaking to pay B to go to college but is promising a gratuity, there is no offer. c.  Offer as contract .  A promise made by the offeror as part of his offer may itself be a contract.  Such 
a contract is commonly called an "option".  See § 25.

Comment a .  That the key concept involves giving the addressee the apparent power to conclude a  
contract without further action by the other party, see Maryland Supreme Corp. v. Blake Co., 279 Md.

§ 25 Option Contracts   
 
An option contract is a promise which meets the requirements for the formation of a contract 
and limits the promisor's power to revoke an offer.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  "Option."  A promise which constitutes an option contract may be contained in the offer itself, or it may be made separately in a collateral offer to keep the main offer open.  Such promises are commonly called "options." But the word "option" is also often used for any continuing offer, even 
though revocable, and indeed is sometimes used to refer to any power to make a choice.  To avoid ambiguity the phrase "option contract" is used in this Restate ment.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A promises B under seal or in return for $ 100 paid or promised by B that A will sell B 100 shares of stock in a specified corporation for $ 5,000 at any time within thirty days that B selects.  There is an option contract under which B has an option. 
2.  A offers to sell B Blackacre for $ 5,000 at any time within thirty days.  Subsequently A promises 
under seal or in return for $ 100 paid or promised by B that the offer will not be revoked.  There is an option contract under which B has an option. b.  The need for irrevocable offers.  To provide the offeree with a dependable basis for decision 
whether or not to accept, the rule in many legal systems is that an offer is irrevocable unless it provides otherwise.  The common -law rule, on the other hand, resting on the requirement of 
consideration, permits the revocation of offers even though stated to be firm.  See Comment a to § 42.  The offeree's need for a dependable basis for decision is met in part by the common- law rule that 
maile d acceptance prevents revocation.  See § 63.  Where more is needed, the option contract is 
available.  
c.  Types of option contracts .  The traditional common -law devices for making an offer irrevocable are 
the giving of consideration and the affixing of a seal.  The requirement of consideration may be met in any of the ways permitted by the rules stated in §§ 71 -81: payment of money or some other 
performance by the offeree is effective, as is a promise of such performance; one option may furnish considerati on for another, and a single consideration may support both a present contract and a future 
option.  Compare Illustration 3 to § 47; see § 45 as to the beginning or tender of performance. 
The option under seal is the traditional mode of making an offer irrevocable without consideration.  
Cf. § 95.  In some cases a negotiable instrument or a letter of credit may operate as an offer binding without consideration.  See Uniform Commercial Code §§ 3- 408, 5- 105, 5- 106.  Offers may also be

 josh glen  Page 77 of 189 irrevocable by statute o r by virtue of reliance by the offeree or other circumstances bringing into play 
one of the rules stated in §§ 82-94.  See, especially, § 87. 
d.  Effect of option contract .  The principal legal consequence of an option contract is that stated in 
this Secti on: it limits the promisor's power to revoke an offer.  The termination of the offeree's power 
of acceptance is subject to the requirements for discharge of a contractual duty.  See § 37.  A revocation by the offeror is not of itself effective, and the off er is properly referred to as an irrevocable 
offer.

Comment c .  For a discussion of the consideration supporting an option and implied conditions to its 
exercise, see Joseph v. Wilson, 57 Ill. App.3d 212, 14 Ill. Dec. 831, 372 N.E.2d 1110 (1978) ; O'Brien 
v. Board of Educ., 70 Ill. App.3d 604, 27 Ill. Dec. 141, 388 N.E.2d 1104 (1979) . The effect of a seal 
after an offeree's signature was discussed in some detail in Humble Oil & Ref. Co. v. Cox, supra.  An 
option provision to purchase additional land "as mutually agreed upon by both parties" was held too 
indefinite to be enforced in Lucey v. Hero Int'l Corp., 361 Mass. 569, 281 N.E.2d 266 (1972) . 
Comment d .  Despite equity's dislike of forfeitures, cf. §§ 229, 361, requirements governing the time 
and manner of exercise of a power of acceptance under an option contract are applied strictly.  It is reasoned that any relaxation of termswould substantively extend the option contract to subject one 
party to greater obligations than he bargained for.  See Holiday Inns of America v. Knight, 70 Cal.2d

Topic 3 - Making of Offers  
 
§ 26 Preliminary Negotiations   
 
A manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain is not an offer if the person to whom it is 
addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it d oes not intend to conclude a 
bargain until he has made a further manifestation of assent.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Interpretation of proposals for exchange .  The rule stated in this Section is a special application of 
the definition in § 24 and of the principles governing the interpretation of manifestations of assent.  See § 20 and Chapter 9.  Conduct which resembles an offer may not be so intended either b ecause 
there is an intent not to affect legal relations (see § 18), or because the actor does not intend to engage in the conduct (see § 19), or because the proposal is not addressed to the recipient or is not received by the addressee (see § 23), or because the proposal contemplates a gift rather than a bargain (see Comment b  to § 24).  This Section deals rather with the case where the actor intends to make a bargain 
in the future, but only if he makes some further manifestation of assent.  If the addressee of a proposal has reason to know that no offer is intended, there is no offer even though he understands it to be an offer.  "Reason to know" depends not only on the words or other conduct, but also on the circumstances, including previous communications  of the parties and the usages of their community or 
line of business.  
b.  Advertising .  Business enterprises commonly secure general publicity for the goods or services they 
supply or purchase.  Advertisements of goods by display, sign, handbill, newspaper, radio or television are not ordinarily intended or understood as offers to sell.  T he same is true of catalogues, 
price lists and circulars, even though the terms of suggested bargains may be stated in some detail.  It is of course possible to make an offer by an advertisement directed to the general public (see § 29), but there must ord inarily be some language of commitment or some invitation to take action without 
further communication. Illustrations:  
1.  A, a clothing merchant, advertises overcoats of a certain kind for sale at $ 50.  This is not an offer, but an invitation to the public to come and purchase.  The addition of the words "Out they go Saturday; First Come First Served" might make the advertisement an offer.  
2.  A advertises that he will pay $ 5 for every copy of a certain book that may be sent to him.  This is an offer, and A is bound to pay $ 5 for every copy sent while the offer is unrevoked. c.  Quotation of price .  A "quotation" of price is usually a statement of price per unit of quantity; it 
may omit the quantity to be sold, time and place of delivery, terms of payment, and other terms.  It is sometimes associated with a price list or circular, but the word "quote" is commonly understood as 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 26  
 josh glen  Page 80 of 189 inviting an offer rather than as making one, even when directed to a particular customer.  But just as 
the word "offer" does not necessarily mean that an offer is intended, so the word "quote" may be used in an offer.  In determining whether an offer is made relevant factors include the terms of any previous inquiry, the completeness of the terms of the suggested bargain, and the number of persons to whom a communication is addressed.  
Illustration: 
3.  A writes to B, "I can quote you flour at $ 5 a barrel in carload lots." This is not an offer, in view of 
the word "quote" and incompleteness of the terms.  The same words, in response to an inquiry specifying detailed terms, would probably be an offer; and if A added "for immediate acceptance" the intent to make an offer would be unmistakable. d.  Invitation of bids or other offers .  Even though terms are specified in detail, it is commo n for one 
party to request the other to make an offer.  The words "Make me an offer" would normally indicate that no offer is being made, and other conduct such as the announcement of an auction may have similar effect.  See § 28.  A request for bids on a construction project is similar, even though the practice may be to accept the lowest bid conforming to specifications and other requirements.  And forms used or statements made by a traveling salesman may make it clear that the customer is making an offer  to be accepted at the salesman's home office.  See § 69.  
Illustration: 
4.  A writes B, "I am eager to sell my house.  I would consider $ 20,000 for it." B promptly answers, "I 
will buy your house for $ 20,000 cash." There is no contract.  A's letter is a request or suggestion that an offer be made to him.  B has made an offer. e.  Written contract documents .  A standard method of making an offer is to submit to the offeree a 
written agreement signed by the offeror and to invite the offeree to sign on a line provided for that purpose.  See § 27.  But the signature even in such a case is not conclusive if the other party has reason to know that no offer is intended.  More common is the use of promissory expressions or words of assent in unsigned documents or letters where the document is intended not as an offer but only as a step in the preliminary negotiation of terms, or as a specimen for use in other transactions, or as something to be shown to a third person to influence his action.  Reason to know that such is the intention may exist even though the document on its face seems to be clear and unambiguous. f.  Preliminary manifestations as terms of later offer .  Even though a communication is not an offer, it 
may contain promises or representations which ar e incorporated in a subsequent offer and hence 
become part of the contract made when the offer is accepted.  Indeed, the preliminary communication may thus form part of a written contract, or of a memorandum satisfying the Statute of Frauds, or of an integ rated contract.  See Comment c  to § 20, §§ 132, 202.

Contracts §§ 22-29 (1963 & Supp. 1980); Murray, Contracts § 24 (1977). 
Comment a .  On the importance of context in resolving whether an offer is made, see R.E. Crummer & 
Co. v. Nuveen, 147 F.2d 3 (7th Cir. 1945) . In Redman v. Whitney, 541 S.W.2d 889 (Tex. Civ. App. 
1976) , the words "it is my understanding that my client is desirous of paying the balance" were held 
not definite enough to be an offer. 
Comment b .  Illustration 1 is based on Illustration 1 to former § 25 and is supported by many cases; 
see, e.g., Craft v. Elder & Johnston Co., 38 N.E.2d 416 (Ohio Ct. App. 1941) ; Steinberg v. Chicago

Comment c .  Typical examples of price quotations held not to be offers are found in Thomas J. 
Sheehan v. Crane Co., 418 F.2d 642 (8th Cir. 1969) ; Interstate Indus. v. Barclay Indus., 540 F.2d 868 
(7th Cir. 1976) . In both opinions the courts went beyond the bare words of the price quotation to 
consider the surrounding circumstances.  In Southworth v. Oliver, 284 Or. 361, 587 P.2d 994 (1978) , 
the court found that the impact upon a reasonable recipient turned a quotation into an offer.  In 
Maryland Supreme Corp. v. Blake, 279 Md. 531, 369 A.2d 1017 (1977) , a "quotation" by a 
subcontractor, which stated that "the price will be guaranteed to hold throughout the job" was held to 
be an offer.  Illustration 3 is based on Illustration 2 to former § 25; its  last sentence is based on 
Fairmount Glass Works v. Crunden-Martin Woodenware Co., 106 Ky. 659, 51 S.W. 196 (1899) .

§ 27 Existence of Contract Where Written Memorial Is Contemplated   
 
Manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to conclude a contract will not be 
prevented from so operating by the fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare 
and adopt a written memorial thereof; but the circumstances may show that the agreements are preliminary negotiations.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Parties who plan to make a final written instrument as the expression of their contract necessarily discuss the proposed terms of the contract before they enter into it and often, before the final writing is made, agree upon all the terms which they plan to incorporate therein.  This they may do orally or by 
exchange of several writings.  It is possible thus to make a contract the terms of which include an obligation to execute subsequently a final writing which shall contain certain provisions.  If parties have definitely agreed that they  will do so, and that the final writing shall contain these provisions and 
no others, they have then concluded the contract. b.  On the other hand, if either party knows or has reason to know that the other party regards the agreement as incomplete and intends that no obligation shall exist until other terms are assented to or until the whole has been reduced to another written form, the preliminary negotiations and agreements do not constitute a contract. c.  Among the circumstances which may be helpful in determining whether a contract has been 
concluded are the following: the extent to which express agreement has been reached on all the terms to be included, whether the contract is of a type usually put in writing, whether it needs a formal writing for its full expression, whether it has few or many details, whether the amount involved is large or small, whether it is a common or unusual contract, whether a standard form of contract is widely used in similar transactions, and whether either party takes any  action in preparation for 
performance during the negotiations.  Such circumstances may be shown by oral testimony or by correspondence or other preliminary or partially complete writings.  
d.  Even though a binding contract is made before a contemplated written memorial is prepared and adopted, the subsequent written document may make a binding modification of the terms previously agreed to.

§ 28 Auctions   
 
(1)  At an auction, unless a contrary intention is manifested,  
(a)  the auctioneer invites offers from successive bidders which he may accept or reject;  
(b)  when goods are put up without reserve, the auctioneer makes an offer to sell at any price bid 
by the highest bidder, and after the auctioneer calls for bids the goods cannot be withdrawn 
unless no bid is made within a reasonable time;  
(c)  whether or not the auction is without reserve, a bidder may withdraw his bid until the 
auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.  
(2)  Unless a contrary intention is manifested, bids at an auction embody terms made known by advertisement, posting or other publication of which bidders are or should be aware, as modified by any announcement made by the auctioneer when the goods are put up.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Manifestation of contrary intention.  The rules stated in this Section reflect the usual understanding at an auction sale.  Established auctions often have their own customary rules, made known by publication or by announcement at the commencement of the auction.  Such rules prevail even though they are contrary to the rules stated here.  Compare the phrase, "unless otherwise agreed," explained in the Introductory Note to this Restatement; see Uniform Commercial Code §§ 1 -102, 1- 205, 2-328.  
But where an auction is held pursuant to statute or court order, there may be requirements or terms which cannot be varied by private agreement. b.  Auction with reserve .  An auction as ordinarily conducted furnishes an illustration of the principle 
stated in § 26.  The auctioneer, by beginning to auction property, does  not impliedly say: "I offer to 
sell this property to which ever of you makes the highest bid," but rather requests that the bidders make offers to him, as indeed he frequently states in his remarks to those before him.  Hence, it is understood that he may reject all bids and withdraw the goods from sale until he announces 
completion of the sale.  Similarly, under § 42, a bidder may withdraw his bid at any time before the announcement of completion.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-328(3). Illustrations:  
1.  A publishes an advertisement saying that he will sell his household goods at public auction at a specific time and place.  This in no way affects his legal relations.  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 28  
 josh glen  Page 85 of 189 2.  A's auctioneer, in Illustration 1, at the specified time and place holds up a chatt el and says, "How 
much am I bid for this?" After each bid is made he urges others to bid higher.  Each bidder makes an 
offer to the auctioneer, but he makes no offer to them. c.  Advertisement for bids.  Governmental agencies or private persons often adver tise for bids from 
construction contractors prepared to undertake the building of a building or other structure, or from persons prepared to supply goods or services.  It may be customary or required by law that the contract be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder whose bid conforms to published specifications.  A bidder in such a case may seek bids from subcontractors for part of the work.  The rule in such cases is much like that governing auctions -- unless a contrary intention is manifested, the advertisement is 
not an offer but a request for offers; bidders on both prime contract and subcontract make offers when they submit bids; and all bids may be rejected.  As to irrevocable bids, see § 25. Illustrations:  
3.  A advertises, "I offer my farm Blackacre for sale to the highest cash bidder and undertake to make conveyance to the person submitting the highest bid received at the address below within the next thirty days." This is an offer, and each bid operates as an acceptance creating rights and dutie s 
conditional on no higher bid being received within thirty days. 
4.  The United States Navy Department advertises for bids on a naval station, the bids to be opened on 
June 6.  Several prospective bidders, including A, request B to submit a "quotation" for the electrical work.  B submits to A an "estimate", stating "If our estimate used wire us collect prior to June 6 or else same is withdrawn." A sends the requested telegram and submits a bid which turns out to be low on June 6.  Whether or not the advert isement reserved the right to reject all bids, the Navy has that 
right; B has made an offer which A can accept or reject after the Navy awards the contract to him.  
d.  Auction without reserve .  Where an auction is advertised as "without reserve" and the goods are put 
up without any contrary announcement, or where the auctioneer opens the sale by announcing that the sale will be "without reserve," the normal understanding is that the goods are not to be withdrawn.  There is an offer, and it is made irrevocab le by Uniform Commercial Code § 2-328(3), unless no bid is 
made within a reasonable time.  See § 25.  Nevertheless, unless a contrary intention is manifested, bids can be withdrawn until the auctioneer announces completion of the sale, as in other auctions; and a bid is discharged when a higher bid is made, even though the higher bid is later withdrawn.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -328(3). 
Illustration: 
5.  A advertises a sale of his household furniture without reserve.  An article is put up for sale without 
contrary announcement and B is the highest bidder; but A, dissatisfied with the bidding, either accepts a higher fictitious bid from an agent employed for the purpose, or openly withdraws the article from sale.  A is bound by contract to sell the article to B.  Neither B nor the others attending the auction 
have legal ground for complaint if A withdraws the remaining furniture from sale before it is actually put up. e.  Published and announced terms .  The terms on which goods are to be sold at auction are  often 
made known in advertisements or catalogues or posted at the place where the auction is to be held.  When the goods are put up, the auctioneer commonly refers to such terms, and sometimes he announces a modification of the published terms.  Ordinarily bidders are or should be aware of terms so published or announced.  A bid need not repeat such terms; it is understood as embodying them.  Hence the bidder is held to the published or announced terms, even though he may have neglected to read them or may  have arrived at the auction after the announcement was made.  Theoretically, a 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 28  
 josh glen  Page 86 of 189 bidder could make an offer on terms different from those announced, but bidders seldom or never do 
so.

regulations governing the authority of var ious forestry officers.  In Coleman v. Duncan, 540 S.W.2d

right to reject any or all bids on these items," but the items were never specified.  The court agreed that the announced terms governed, even if the bidder was not present when they were announced.  However, because the t erms applied only to unspecified items, the court refused to permit a high bid 
to be rejected after the auctioneer accepted it by striking down the item bid on.  See also Kendall v.

§ 29 To Whom an Offer Is Addressed   
 
(1)  The manifested intention of the offeror determines the person or persons in whom is created 
a power of acceptance.  
(2)  An offer may create a power of acceptance in a specified person or in one or more of a specified group or class of persons, acting separately or together, or in anyone or everyone who makes a specified promise or renders a specified performance.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Terms of offer control .  The rule stated in Subsection (1) is an elaboration of the definition of offer 
in § 24, and it is to be read in the light of the rules stated in §§ 23 and 26.  The offeror is the master of his offer; just as the making of any offer at all can be avoided by appropriate language or other conduct, so the power of acceptance can be narrowly limited.  The offeror is bound only in accordance with his manifested assent; he is not bound just because he receives a consideration as good as or better than the one he bargained for.  But if he knows or has reason to know that he is creating an appearance of assent, he may be bound by that appearance.  These considerations apply to the identity of the offeree or offerees as well as to the mode of manifesting acceptance (see § 30) and the 
substance of the exchange (see §§ 31, 32, 58). b.  General offers.  An offer may create separate powers of acceptance in an unlimited number of persons, and the exercise of the power by one person may or may not extinguish the power of another.  Where one acceptor only is to be selected, various methods of selection are possible: for example, "first come, first served" (see Illustration 1 to § 26), the highest bidder (see Illustration 3 to § 28), or the winner of a contest.  Who can accept, and how, is determined by interpretation of the offer. Illustrations:  
1.  A publishes an offer of reward to whoever will give him certain information.  There is no indication that A intends to pay more than once.  Any person learning of the offer has power to accept (see Comments a and c to § 23), but the giving of the information by one terminates the power of 
every other person.  
2.  A, a bank, issues a traveler's letter of credit promising to repay anyone who makes advances t o a 
named beneficiary, up to a certain amount, the amounts advanced to be noted on the letter of credit.  This creates a power of acceptance in anyone to whom the letter is presented, but only if the notation is made and only so long as the noted amounts do not exceed the maximum.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 5 -108.

Topic 3 - Making of Offers  
 
§ 30 Form of Acceptance Invited   
 
(1)  An offer may invite or require acceptance to be made by an affirmative answer in words, or 
by performing or refraining from performing a specified act, or may empower the offeree to make a selection of terms in his acceptance.  
(2)  Unless otherwise in dicated by the language or the circumstances, an offer invites acceptance 
in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Required form .  The offeror is the master of his offer.  See Comment a to § 29.  The form of 
acceptance is less likely to affect the substance of the bargain than the identity of the offeree, and is often quite immaterial.  But the offeror is entitled to insist on a particular mode of manifestation of assent.  The terms of the offer  may limit acceptance to a particular mode; whether it does so is a 
matter of interpretation.  
Illustration: 
1.  A sends a letter to B stating the terms of a proposed contract.  At the end he writes, "You can 
accept this offer only by signing on the dotted line below my own signature." a replies by telegram, "I accept your offer." There is no contract.  
b.  Invited form .  Insistence on a particular form of acceptance is unusual.  Offers often make no 
express reference to the form of acceptance; sometimes ambi guous language is used.  Language 
referring to a particular mode of acceptance is often intended and understood as suggestion rather than limitation; the suggested mode is then authorized, but other modes are not precluded.  In other cases language which i n terms refers to the mode of acceptance is intended and understood as referring to 
some more important aspect of the transaction, such as the time limit for acceptance.  See §§ 60, 63.  
c.  Term supplied in acceptance .  An offer may contain a choice of terms, and may invite or require an 
acceptance making a selection among the terms stated.  Or the offer may indicate a term such as quantity to be filled in by the offeree.  An acceptance to be effective must comply with the terms of the offer, and those t erms or the circumstances may make it plain that the acceptance must specify 
terms.  Section 60.  In such cases the offer does not fail for indefiniteness, but no contract is made by an attempted acceptance which does not supply the term as indicated.  See § 33.  The offer assents in 
advance to the term chosen or filled in by the offeree. Illustration: 
2.  A offers to deliver to B at any time during the next 30 days any amount of coal, up to 100 tons, for 
which B will promise to pay $ 15 a ton.  In order to accept this offer B must specify the amount of 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 30  
 josh glen  Page 90 of 189 coal he desires and must promise to pay $ 15 a ton for it.  An order for 50 tons by B concludes a 
definite agreement.  
d.  Form not specified .  Interpretation of the offer is necessary in order to determine whether there is 
any limitation on the mode of acceptance.  The meaning given the offer by the offeree controls if it is a meaning of which the offeror knew or had reason to know.  See §§ 19, 20.  Since limitation is not customary, the offeror has reason to know that the offeree may understand that the offer can be accepted in any reasonable manner, and a contrary intention is not operative unless manifested.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206(1). Illustrations:  
3.  A orally offers to sell and deliver to B 100 tons of coal at $ 20 a ton payable 30 days after delivery.  B replies, "I accept your offer." B has manifested assent in a sufficient form, even though A neither suggested nor required that form. 
4.  A makes a bid at an auction sale.  By the usual custom at auctions, the auctioneer may accept by 
letting the hammer fall, by saying "Sold", or by any words manifesting acceptance. e.  Reasonable manner .  As to acceptance by promise or nonpromissory performance, see § 32.  Cases 
where the contract leaves ter ms to be chosen in the course of performance are the subject of § 34.  
What manner and medium are reasonable is governed by the rules stated in §§ 60 and 65.  Sometimes, though not ordinarily, even silent inaction may be effective as a mode of acceptance.  See § 69.

§ 31 Offer Proposing a Single Contract or a Number of Contracts   
 
An offer may propose the formation of a single contract by a single acceptance or the formation 
of a number of contracts by successive acceptances from time to time.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Separate contracts .  An offer may request several acts or promises as the indivisible exchange for 
the promise or promises in the offer, or it may request a series of contracts to be made from time to time.  Whether several promises create several contracts or are all part of one contract is determined by principles of interpretation stated in Chapter 9. b.  Continuing guaranty .  A standard example of a divisible offer is the contin uing guaranty, the 
promise to guarantee performance of such obligations of a specified type as a third party may incur to the offeree from time to time.  An offer of suretyship may be directed to one offeree or to many offerees; it may contemplate a single extension of credit by the offeree or many; it may or may not be 
expressly limited in time or amount.  See Restatement of Security §§ 82- 88.  Where there is a 
continuing guaranty as to future loans or sales to be made by the offeree and each loan or sale furnishes the sole consideration for the corresponding part of the guaranty, the guaranty is oftencharacterized as an offer for a series of separate contracts.  
This characterization, if sound, means that the offer is revocable and revoked by death (see §§ 47, 48), and that a separate acceptance is required for each contract (see § 50 et seq.).  Often, however, the characterization is unsound.  Thus, where the rule of § 54 is inapplicable because the offer requests a notification, although communication of a cceptance is required, a single notice of intention to act is 
ordinarily sufficient.  Again, where the guaranty is under seal or is supported by a consideration, it is more than a mere offer.  Even in such cases guaranties are commonly revocable not only w here a 
power of revocation is expressly reserved or fairly implied but also in circumstances where there is no manifested intention to reserve such a power.  
Whether the case is one of divisible offer or of reserved power, the power of revocation is reinfor ced 
by the considerations underlying limitation of the recovery of damages for avoidable harm and denial of specific performance where return performance is not well secured (see §§ 350, 363).  Even if there is no absolute power of revocation, as where a substantial consideration is given at the outset, those considerations may limit relief, once notice of revocation is given, to obligations incurred before the promisee has had a reasonable opportunity to prevent further obligations from arising or to secur e a 
substitute surety.  In many States statutes give particular types of sureties a right to apply to the court for relief from future obligations.  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 31  
 josh glen  Page 93 of 189 c.  Sale of goods .  The standing offer for the sale or purchase of goods furnishes another example of 
the divisible offer.  Continuing arrangements for the sale of goods may provide terms for contracts 
made under them even though there is no offer until particular goods are ordered or actually delivered.  See Illustration 4 to § 21.  Or there may be a divisible standing offer which can be separately accepted with respect to each lot of goods by either a promise or a performance.  See Comment c  to § 32.  Or 
the continuing arrangement may itself be a binding contract, as in the case of an output or requirements con tract.  See § 77. 
Illustrations:  
1.  A offers B, a railway company, such quantities of certain goods as B's storekeeper may order from time to time during the next twelve months.  In the absence of a revocation, each order of B's storekeeper during that period creates a separate contract for the quantity ordered. 
2.  A offers B to sell and deliver to him during the following year any quantity of goods between 4000 
and 6000 pounds in amount, acceptance to specify the total quantity.  B must within a reasonable time specify a particular amount of not less than 4000 pounds and not more than 6000 pounds in order to create a contract; and there can be but one acceptance and one contract.  
3.  A offers B to sell him in monthly installments the coal which B may require in his business during the next six months, not exceeding one hundred tons in any one month.  B has an established manufacturing business which has used an average of 75 tons of coal a month for several years.  The offer is one for a single contract under which B promises not to buy coal elsewhere during the six months unless he has excess requirements.

Topic 3 - Making of Offers  
 
§ 32 Invitation of Promise or Performance   
 
In case of doubt an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to accept either by promising t o 
perform what the offerrequests or by rendering the performance, as the offeree chooses.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Promise or performance.  In the ordinary commercial bargain  a party expects to be bound only if 
the other party either renders the return performance or binds himself to do so either by express words 
or by part performance or other conduct.  Unless the language or the circumstances indicate that one party is to have an option, therefore, the usual offer invites an acceptance which either amounts to performance or constitutes a promise.  The act of acceptance may be merely symbolic of assent and promise, or it may also be part or all of the performance bargained for.  See §§ 2, 4, 18, 19.  In either case notification of the offeror may be necessary.  See §§ 54, 56. 
The rule of this Section is a particular application of the rule stated in § 30(2).  The offeror is often 
indifferent as to whether acceptance takes the f orm of words of promise or acts of performance, and 
his words literally referring to one are often intended and understood to refer to either.  Where performance takes time, however, the begining of performance may constitute a promise to complete it.  See  § 62. 
Illustrations:  
1.  A writes B, "If you will mow my lawn next week, I will pay you $ 10." B can accept A's offer either by promptly promising to mow the lawn or by mowing it as requested. 
2.  A says to B: "If you finish that table you are making and deliver it to my house today, I will give 
you $ 100 for it." B replies, "I'll do it." There is a contract.  B could also accept by delivering the table as requested.  
b.  Offer limited to acceptance by performance only.  Language or circumstances sometimes make it 
clear that the offeree is not to bind himself in advance of performance.  His promise may be worthless to the offeror, or the circumstances may make it unreasonable for the offeror to expect a firm commitment from the offeree.  In such cases, the offer does not invite a promissory acceptance, and a promise is ineffective as an acceptance.  Examples are found in offers of reward or of prizes in a contest, made to a large number of people but to be accepted by only one.  See § 29.  Non- commercial 
arrangements among relatives and friends (see Comment a  to § 19, Comment c  to § 21) and offers 
which leave important terms to be fixed by the offeree in the course of performance (see §§ 33, 34) provide other examples. 
It is a separate question whether the offeree undertakes any responsibility to complete performance 
once begun, or whether he takes any responsibility for the quality of the performance when completed. 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 32  
 josh glen  Page 96 of 189 Illustrations:  
3.  A publishes the following offer: "I will pay $ 50 for the return of my diamond bracelet lost 
yesterday on State Street." B sees this advertisement and at once sends a letter to A, saying "I accept your offer and will search for this bracelet." There is no acceptance. 
4.  A writes to B, his nephew aged 16, that if B will refrain from drinking, using tobacco, swearing, 
and playing cards or billiards for money until he becomes 21 years of age, A will pay B $ 5,000.  B makes a written reply promising so to refrain.  There is probably no contract.  But if B begins to refrain, A may  be bound by an option contract under § 45; and if B refrains until he becomes 21, A is 
bound to pay him $ 5,000. c.  Shipment of goods .  An order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment normally 
invites acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by prompt or current shipment.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -206(1)(b).  If non- conforming goods are shipped, the shipment may be an 
acceptance and at the same time a breach.  But there is no acceptance if the offeror has reason to know that none is intended, as where the offeree promptly notifies him that non- conforming goods are being 
shipped and are offered only as an accommodation to him. Illustrations:  
5.  A mails a written order to B, offering to buy specified machinery on specified terms.  The order provides, "Ship at once." B immediately mails a letter to A, saying "I accept your offer and will ship at once." This is a sufficient acceptance to form a contract.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -206(1). 
6.  In Illustration 5, instead of m ailing a letter of acceptance, B immediately ships the machinery as 
requested.  This is a sufficient acceptance to form a contract.  If the machinery is defective, the shipment is both an acceptance forming a contract and a breach of that contract, unless B promptly notifies A that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to A.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206(1).

§ 33 Certainty   
 
(1)  Even though a manifestation of intention is intended to be understood as an offer, it cannot 
be accepted so as to form a contract unless the terms of the contract are reasonably certain.  
(2)  The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy. 
(3)  The fact that one or more terms of a proposed bargain are left open or uncertain may show 
that a manifestation of intention is not intended to be understood as an offer or as an acceptance.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Certainty of terms .  It is sometimes said that the agreement must be capable of b eing given an exact 
meaning and that all the performances to be rendered must be certain.  Such statements may be appropriate in determining whether a manifestation of intention is intended to be understood as an offer.  But the actions of the parties may show conclusively that they have intended to conclude a binding agreement, even though one or more terms are missing or are left to be agreed upon.  In such cases courts endeavor, if possible, to attach a sufficiently definite meaning to the bargain.  
An offer which appears to be indefinite may be given precision by usage of trade or by course of dealing between the parties.  Terms may be supplied by factual implication, and in recurring situations the law often supplies a term in the absence of agreement to  the contrary.  See § 5, defining "term." 
Where the parties have intended to conclude a bargain, uncertainty as to incidental or collateral matters is seldom fatal to the existence of the contract.  If the essential terms are so uncertain that there is no basis for deciding whether the agreement has been kept or broken, there is no contract.  But even in such cases partial performance or other action in reliance on the agreement may reinforce it under § 34. b.  Certainty in basis for remedy.  The rule stated in Subsection (2) reflects the fundamental policy that contracts should be made by the parties, not by the courts, and hence that remedies for breach of contract must have a basis in the agreement of the parties.  Where the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy, the same policy supports the granting of the remedy.  The test is not certainty as to what the parties were to do nor as to the exact amount of damages due to the plaintiff; uncertainty may preclude one remedy without affecting another.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-204(3) and Comment. 
Thus the degree of certainty required may be affected by the dispute which arises and by the remedy 
sought.  Courts decide the disputes before them, not other hypothetical disputes which might have 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 33  
 josh glen  Page 99 of 189 arisen.  It is less likely that a reasonably certain term will be supplied by construction as to a matter 
which has been the subject of controversy between the parties than as to one which is raised only as  an 
afterthought.  In some cases greater definiteness may be required for specific performance than for an award of damages; in others the impossibility of accurate assessment of damages may furnish a reason for specific relief.  Partial relief may sometim es be granted when uncertainty prevents full -scale 
enforcement through normal remedies.  See §§ 357-62. Illustrations:  
1.  A agrees to sell and B to buy goods for $ 2,000, $ 1,000 in cash and the "balance on installment terms over a period of two years," with a provision for liquidated damages.  If it is found that both parties manifested an intent to conclude a binding agreement, the indefiniteness of the quoted language does not prevent the award of the liquidated damages. 
2.  A agrees to sell and B to buy a specific tract of land for $ 10,000, $ 4,000 in cash and $ 6,000 on 
mortgage.  A agrees to obtain the mortgage loan for B or, if unable to do so, to lend B the amount, but the terms of loan are not stated, although both parties manifest an intent to conclude a binding agreement.  The contract is too indefinite to support a decree of specific performance against B, but B may obtain such a decree if he offers to pay the full price in cash. c.  Preliminary negotiations .  The rule stated in Subsection (3) is a particular application of the rule 
stated in § 26 on preliminary negotiations.  Incompleteness of terms is one of the principal reasons why advertisements and price quotations are ordinarily not interpreted as offers.  Similarly, if the parties to negotiations for sale manifest an intention not to be bound until the price is fixed or agreed, the law gives effect to that intention.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -305(4).  The more terms the 
parties leave open, the less likely it is that they have intended to conclude a binding agreement.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 204 and Comment. 
d.  Uncertain time of performance .  Valid contracts are often made which do not specify the time for 
performance.  Where the contract calls for a single performance such as the rendering of a service or the delivery of goods, the time for performance is a "reasonable time." Compare § 41 on the time for accepting an offer; see Uniform Commercial Code §§ 1- 204, 2- 309(1).  Payment is due when the 
service is completed or the goods  received.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 310.  When the contract 
calls for successive performances but is indefinite in duration, it is commonly terminable by either party, with or without a requirement of reasonable notice.  Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2 -309(2), 
(3). 
Illustrations:  
3.  A and B promise that certain performances shall be mutually rendered by them "immediately" or "at once," or "promptly," or "as soon as possible," or "in about one month." All these promises are sufficiently definite to form co ntracts.  
4.  A promises B to sell certain goods to him, and B promises to pay a specified price therefor.  No time of performance is fixed.  The time for delivery and payment is a reasonable time.  Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2- 309(1), 2 -310(a).  What is a reasonable time depends on the nature, purpose 
and circumstances of the action to be taken.  Uniform Commercial Code § 1-204(2). 
5.  A offers to employ B for a stated compensation as long as B is able to do specified work, or as long 
as a specified business is carried on, and B accepts the terms offered.  The length of the engagement is sufficiently definite for the formation of a contract. 
6.  A promises B to serve B as chauffeur, and B promises to pay him $ 100 a month.  Nothing further 
is stated as to th e duration of the employment.  There is at once a contract for one month's service.  At 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 33  
 josh glen  Page 100 of 189 the end of the first month, in the absence of revocation, there is a contract for a second month.  But 
circumstances may show that such an agreement merely specifies the rate of compensation for an employment at will.  
e.  Indefinite price .  Where the parties manifest an intention not to be bound unless the amount of 
money to be paid by one of them is fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 305(4).  Where they intend to conclude a contract for the sale of 
goods, however, and the price is not settled, the price is a reasonable price at the time of delivery if (a) nothing is said as to price, or (b) the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree, or (c) the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 305(1).  Or one 
party may be given power to fix the price within limits set by agreement or custom or good faith.  Similar principles apply to contracts for the rendition of service.  But substantial damages cannot be recovered unless they can be estimated with reasonab le certainty (§ 352), and if the contract is entirely 
executory and specific performance is not an appropriate remedy, relief may be limited to the recovery of benefits conferred and specific expense incurred in reliance on the contract.  
Illustrations:  
7.  A promises to sell and B to buy goods "at cost plus a nice profit." The quoted words strongly 
indicate that the parties have not yet concluded a bargain. 
8.  A promises to do a specified piece of work and B promises to pay a price to be thereafter mutuall y 
agreed.  The provision for future agreement as to price strongly indicates that the parties do not intend 
to be bound.  If they manifest an intent to be bound, the price is a reasonable price at the time for doing the work. f.  Other indefinite terms .  Promises may be indefinite in other aspects than time and price.  The more 
important the uncertainty, the stronger the indication is that the parties do not intend to be bound; minor items are more likely to be left to the option of one of the parties or to what is customary or reasonable.  Even when the parties intend to enter into a contract, uncertainty may be so great as to frustrate their intention.  Thus a promise by A to give B employment, even though consideration is paid for it, does not provide  a basis for any remedy if neither the character of the employment nor the 
compensation therefor is stated.  In such cases the consideration paid, or its value, can be recovered.  Restatement of Restitution §§ 15, 40, 47, 53. Illustrations:  
9.  A promises B to execute a conveyance in fee or a lease for a year of specified land and B promises to make specified payments therefor.  Although the terms of leases and conveyances vary, the promises are interpreted as providing for documents in the form in common l ocal use, and are 
sufficiently definite to form contracts.  
10.  A promises to sell and B to buy all goods of a certain character which B shall need in his business during the ensuing year.  The quantity to be sold is sufficiently definite to provide a basis for remedy, since the promises are interpreted to refer to B's actual good -faith requirements.  Uniform Commercial 
Code § 2-306. 
11.  A promises B to construct a building according to stated plans and specifications, and B promises 
A to pay $ 30,000 ther efor.  It is also provided that the character of the window fastenings shall be 
subject to further agreement of the parties.  Unless a contrary intention is manifested, the indefiniteness of the agreement with reference to this matter will not prevent the formation of a contract.  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 33  
 josh glen  Page 101 of 189 12.  A and B have a settlement of accounts, and A promises to pay B a stated balance, "errors and 
omissions excepted." A's promise is reasonably certain in the absence of a showing of error or omission, but it may be corrected on such a showing.

§ 34 Certainty and Choice of Terms; Effect of Performance or Reliance   
 
(1)  The terms of a contract may be reasonably certain even though it empowers one or both 
parties to make a selection of terms in the course of performance.  
(2)  Part performance under an agreement may remove uncertainty and establish that a contract enforceable as a bargain has been formed.  
(3)  Action in reliance on an agreement may make a contractual remedy appropriate even though uncertainty is not removed.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Choice in the course of performance .  A bargain may be concluded which leaves a choice of terms 
to be made by one party or the other.  If the agreement is otherwise sufficiently definite to be a contract, it is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 311(1).  The more important the choice is, the 
more it is likely that the parties do  not intend to be bound until the choice is made.  But even on such 
matters as subject matter and price, one party is often given a wide choice.  If the parties intend to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for granting an appropriate r emedy, such 
alternative terms do not invalidate the contract.  See § 33.  Often a basis for remedy can be found in the rule of Comment b to § 362, permitting a remedy in accordance with the alternative chosen or in 
accordance with the alternative that will result in the smallest recovery.  In other cases the failure of 
one party to choose may shift the right to choose to the other party or to an arbitrator or to the court. Illustrations:  
1.  A promises B to give him any one of a number of specified things which A shall choose, and B promises A to pay a specified price.  The agreement is sufficiently definite to be a contract.  A method is provided for determining what A is to give; though what he gives is subject to his choice, he must give some one of the things specified. 
2.  A agrees to sell and B to buy 50,000 pounds of white worsted yarn on a basis which enables the 
parties to compute 48 prices for 48 styles and sizes.  The agreement is sufficiently definite to be a contract.  Unless otherwise agreed specifications relating to assortment of the goods are at the buyer's option, but if B does not make a seasonable specification, A may proceed to perform in any reasonable manner.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2-311. b.  Unlimited choice; good faith and fair dea ling.  If one party to an agreement is given an unlimited 
choice, that party may not be a promisor (see Comment e  to § 2), and the contract may fail for want of 
consideration.  See § 79.  The other party's promise may be unconscionable and may be wholly or  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 34  
 josh glen  Page 104 of 189 partly illegal.  Compare §§ 178, 208; see Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 302.  These difficulties are 
commonly avoided, however, by the fact that the choice granted is limited.  Just as the power of 
selection may be given not only by explicit agreement but also by course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance under the particular agreement or by other implication from circumstances, so limits on the power may be either express or implied.  Often the choice made must be reasonable in the circums tances.  See § 228; Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2- 306, 2- 311(1).  And in any event 
discretionary power granted by a commercial contract must be exercised in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing.  Uniform Commercial Code §§ 1- 203, 2- 103(1)(b).  A price to be fixed 
by a seller or buyer of goods, for example, means a price for him to fix in good faith.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -305(2). 
Illustration: 
3.  A promises B to do specified work or to transfer certain goods or land and B promises A to make 
specified payments if the work or property is satisfactory to B in specified respects.  These promises are sufficiently definite to form contracts, since B's duty depends not on his mere whim but on his exercise of an honest judgment, or in some cases of a reasonable judgment.  See § 228. c.  Subsequent conduct removing uncertainty .  Indefiniteness may prevent enforcement of a contract in 
two different ways: it may mean that a manifestation of intention is not intended to be understood as an offer; or, even though the parties intended to enter into a contract, there may be no sufficient basis 
for giving an appropriate remedy.  See § 33.  Subsequent conduct of one or both parties may remove either obstacle or both.  Preliminary manifestations may propose term s which are incorporated in a 
subsequent offer and become part of a contract.  See Comment f  to § 26.  The contract may then be 
thought of as concluded only at the time of the acceptance of the subsequent offer.  Or part performance may give meaning to indefinite terms of an agreement, or may have the effect of eliminating indefinite alternatives by waiver or modification.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -208.  In 
such cases a bargain may be concluded, but it may be impossible to identify offer or acceptance or  to 
determine the moment of formation.  See § 22(2).  The obstacle of indefiniteness may nevertheless be removed. d.  Reliance and appropriate remedies .  The need for a particular remedy may sometimes become 
apparent as a result of part performance or other action in reliance on an indefinite agreement, even though the original uncertainty remains.  The appropriate remedy may be non- contractual.  Thus 
benefits conferred on the other party under an agreement void for indefiniteness may ordinarily be recovered.  Restatement of Restitution §§ 15, 40, 47, 53.  In some such cases the measure of benefit may appropriately be the value of the plaintiff's performance rather than the economic benefit to the defendant.  See Restatement of Restitution § 155 and Caveat; compare § 370 of this Restatement.  Where one party has suffered loss because of his reliance on such an agreement, the other party may be subject to liability in tort.  See Restatement, Second, Torts § 323, and Caveat; Restatement, Second, Agency § 378. 
In many cases, however, reliance makes appropriate a contractual remedy.  Thus the agreement may 
be treated as divisible and recovery for benefits conferred may then be permitted at the promised rate.  
An express or implied promise may be found to reimburse  expenses incurred pursuant to the indefinite 
agreement.  In some cases partial or full enforcement through an award of damages for breach of contract or a decree of specific performance may become appropriate.  See § 90.  As to detrimental reliance not co nsisting of the performance of the agreement, compare Comment a to § 129. 
Illustrations:

 josh glen  Page 105 of 189 4.  A says to B: "I will employ you for some time at $ 10 a day." An acceptance by B either orally or 
in writing will not create a contract.  But if B serves one or mo re days with A's assent A is bound to 
pay $ 10 for each day's service. 
5.  A agrees to sell and B to buy a specific house and lot for $ 10,000, mortgage terms to be agreed.  
At B's request, reinforced by a threat not to perform, A makes certain alterations  in the house, which 
add nothing to its value.  B then repudiates the agreement without reference to mortgage terms.  A may recover the cost of the alterations.  See § 349. 
6.  A leases land to B for three years, giving B an option to buy the land for $ 10,000 "on terms to be 
agreed on." B occupies the land for three years, making extensive improvements, and seeks to exercise the option, offering to pay "either in cash or upon such terms as A may impose." B may obtain a decree of specific performance.  See Illustration 2 to § 362.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 35 The Offeree's Power of Acceptance   
 
(1)  An offer gives to the offeree a continuing power to complete the manifestation of mutual 
assent by acceptance of the o ffer. 
(2)  A contract cannot be created by acceptance of an offer after the power of acceptance has been terminated in one of the ways listed in § 36.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  "Duration of an offer ."  It is common to speak of the duration "of  an offer." But "offer" is defined 
in § 24 as a manifestation of assent, and the reference here is not to the time occupied by the offeror's conduct but to the duration of its legal operation.  Hence this topic speaks of the duration and termination of the  offeree's power rather than the duration and termination of the offer. 
b.  Continuing power .  Under Subsection (1) the offeree's power arises when the offeror's 
manifestation of assent is complete.  Since the acceptance must have reference to the offer it  is 
ordinarily necessary that the offeree have knowledge of the offer.  See § 23.  Once the power arises it continues until terminated.  Methods of termination are listed in § 36 and explained in the following sections.  There is no requirement that the of fer be accompanied by the mental assent of the offeror, or 
that mental assent which exists at the time of the offer continue until the time of acceptance.  See § 19.  
c.  Creation of contract .  Exercise of the power of acceptance concludes an agreement and a bargain, 
and thus satisfies one of the requirements for formation of an informal contract enforceable as a bargain.  See §§ 17, 18.  But a contract is not created unless the other requirements are met.  Thus there may be no consideration; or impossibility or illegality may prevent any duty of performance from arising.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 36 Methods of Termination of the Power of Acceptance   
 
(1)  An offeree's power of acceptance may be terminated by  
(a)  rejection or counter- offer by the offeree, or 
(b)  lapse of time, or  
(c)  revocation by the offeror, or  
(d)  death or incapacity of the offeror or offeree.  
(2)  In addition, an offeree's power of acceptance is terminated by the non -occurrence of any 
condition of acceptance under the terms of the offer.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Scope .  This Section merely lists the methods of termination which are possible.  The 
circumstances under which each method operates are stated in §§ 36 -49. 
b.  Conditions of acceptance .  Subsection (2) provide s for any condition of acceptance arising under 
the terms of the offer itself.  Compare the definition of "condition" in § 224.  A condition of 
acceptance, like a condition, may be express or implied in fact or constructive.  See Comment c  to § 
226.  Thus by common understanding a reward offer can ordinarily be accepted only once; the first acceptance terminates the power of acceptance of other offerees.  See Illustration 1 to § 29.  Compare the effect on a bid at an auction when a higher bid is made.  See § 28(1)(c). c.  Impossibility and illegality .  The power of acceptance may be terminated by the death or 
destruction of a person or thing essential for performance or by supervening legal prohibition.  The extent to which such events have the effect of a f ailure of a condition of acceptance depends on the 
terms of the offer and on the circumstances.  Such events may also prevent a duty of performance from arising from an acceptance if they occur before the offer is made, or may discharge a duty of performance if they occur after acceptance.  The effects of such events are therefore stated in Chapters 6-12, which deal with Mistake (Chapter 6), Misrepresentation, Duress and Undue Influence (Chapter 
7), Unenforceability on Grounds of Public Policy (Chapter 8), The Scope of Contractual Obligations (including conditions and similar events) (Chapter 9), Performance and Non- performance (Chapter 
10), Impracticability of Performance and Frustration of Purpose (Chapter 11) and Discharge by Assent or Alteration (Chapter 12).

 josh glen  Page 109 of 189 This Section is based on former § 35.  In the former Restatement, Subsections (c) and (d) of that 
Section, dealing with impossibility and illegality, were explained in former §§ 49 and 50.  The Restatement in the Courts shows only on e citation to either of those sections from 1933 to 1954:

(1934) . That case was held governed by former § 502, rendering the contract voidable, rather than 
former § 49, which would prevent the formation of a contract.  See 1 Williston, Contracts § 50A (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts § 90 (1963 & Supp. 1980).

§ 37 Termination of Power of Acceptance Under Option Contract   
 
Notwithstanding §§ 38 -49, the power of acceptance under an option contract is not terminated 
by rejection or counter- offer, by revocation, or by death or incapacity of the offeror, unless the 
requirements are met for the discharge of a contractual duty.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Option contracts .  An option contract is a promise which meets the requisites of a contract and 
limits the promisor's power to revoke an offer.  See § 25.  The power given the offeree by such an 
option differs from a power to specify particulars of performance after a contract is made, since the offeree under an option contract can choose not to undertake any contractual duties at all.  But both types of choice may be given to the same offeree at the same time.  See § 34(1). 
b.  Requirements for discharge .  An option contract binds the offeror and gives rise to a duty of 
performance conditional on the offeree's acceptance exercising the option.  The rules governing discharge of contractual duties therefore apply.  See C hapter 12; compare Comment c  to § 42; § 256 
on the nullification of a repudiation. Illustrations:  
1.  A leases land to B, giving B an option to purchase the land for $ 10,000 in cash during the term of the lease.  Misinterpreting the lease, B attempts to exercise the option by tendering a mortgage for $ 10,000.  A refuses to accept the mortgage.  B retains power to exercise the option by a tender conforming to the terms of the lease. 
2.  A gives B the same option as that stated in Illustration 1.  A receives an offer from C to purchase 
the land and so informs B.  B states that he will not exercise the option and A conveys the land to C.  B's power to exercise the option is terminated.  See §§ 89; 273-85.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 38 Rejection   
 
(1)  An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated by his rejection of the offer, unless the 
offeror has manifested a contrary intention.  
(2)  A manifestation of intention not to accept an offer is a rejection unless the offeree manifests 
an intention to take it under further advisement.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  The probability of reliance .  The legal consequences of a rejection rest on its probable effect on the 
offeror.  An offeror commonly takes steps to prepare for performance in the event that the offer is accepted.  If the offeree states in effect that he declines to accept the offer, it is highly probable that the offeror will c hange his plans in reliance on the statement.  The reliance is likely to take such 
negative forms as failure to prepare or failure to send a notice of revocation, and hence is likely to be difficult or impossible to prove.  To protect the offeror in such r eliance, the power of acceptance is 
terminated without proof of reliance.  This rule also protects the offeree in accordance with his manifested intention that his subsequent conduct is not to be understood as an acceptance. Illustrations:  
1.  A makes an offer to B and adds: "This offer will remain open for a week." B rejects the offer the following day, but later in the week purports to accept it.  There is no contract unless the offer was itself a contract.  B's purported acceptance is itself a new offer.  
2.  A makes an offer to sell water rights to B, and states, "You may accept this offer by applying to the appropriate authority for a permit to use the water." B rejects the offer, obtains water rights elsewhere, and later applies for the permit contempla ted by the offer.  There is no contract.  Even if A's offer was 
a binding option, B has not exercised it. b.  Contrary statement of offeror or offeree.  The rule of this Section is designed to give effect to the intentions of the parties, and a manifestati on of intention on the part of either that the offeree's power 
of acceptance is to continue is effective.  Thus if the offeree states that he rejects the offer for the present but will reconsider it at a future time, there is no basis for a change of position by the offeror in reliance on a rejection, and under Subsection (2) there is no rejection.  Similarly a statement in the offer that it will continue in effect despite a rejection is effective, and a similar statement after a rejection makes a new offer . 
Where the manifestation of intention of either party is misunderstood by the other, the principles underlying § 20 apply.  If the offeror is justified in inferring from the words or conduct of the offeree, interpreted in the light of the offeror's prior words or conduct, that the offeree intends not to accept the 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 38  
 josh glen  Page 113 of 189 offer and not to take it under further advisement, the power of acceptance is terminated.  Compare § 
39.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 39 Counter -Offers   
 
(1)  A counter -offer  is an offer made by an offeree to his offeror relating to the same matter as 
the original offer and proposing a substituted bargain differing from that proposed by the 
original offer.  
(2)  An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated by his making of a counter -offer, unless the 
offeror has manifested a contrary intention or unless the counter- offer manifests a contrary 
intention of the offeree.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Counter- offer as rejection .  It is often said that a counter -offer is a rejection, and it does have the 
same effect in terminating the offeree's power of acceptance.  But in other respects a counter -offer 
differs from a rejection.  A counter -offer must be capable of being accepted; it carries negotiations on 
rather than breaking them off.  The termination of the power of acceptance by a counter -offer merely 
carries out the usual understanding of bargainers that one proposal is dropped when another is taken under consideration; if alternative proposals are to be under considerat ion at the same time, warning is 
expected.  
Illustration: 
1.  A offers B to sell him a parcel of land for $ 5,000, stating that the offer will remain open for thirty 
days.  B replies, "I will pay $ 4,800 for the parcel," and on A's declining that, B writes, within the 
thirty day period, "I accept your offer to sell for $ 5,000." There is no contract unless A's offer was itself a contract (see § 37), or unless A's reply to the counter -offer manifested an intention to renew his 
original offer.  
b.  Qualified ac ceptance, inquiry or separate offer.  A common type of counter -offer is the qualified 
or conditional acceptance, which purports to accept the original offer but makes acceptance expressly conditional on assent to additional or different terms.  See § 59.  Such a counter -offer must be 
distinguished from an unqualified acceptance which is accompanied by a proposal for modification of the agreement or for a separate agreement.  A mere inquiry regarding the possibility of different terms, a request for a better  offer, or a comment upon the terms of the offer, is ordinarily not a counter -offer.  
Such responses to an offer may be too tentative or indefinite to be offers of any kind; or they may deal with new matters rather than a substitution for the original offe r; or their language may manifest an 
intention to keep the original offer under consideration. Illustration: 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 39  
 josh glen  Page 115 of 189 2.  A makes the same offer to B as that stated in Illustration 1, and B replies, "Won't you take less?" A  
answers, "No." An acceptance thereafter by B within the thirty -day period is effective.  B's inquiry 
was not a counter -offer, and A's original offer stands. 
c.  Contrary statement of offeror or offeree.  An offeror may state in his offer that it shall continue for 
a stated time in any event and that in the meanwhile he will be glad to receive counter -offers.  
Likewise an offeree may state that he is holding the offer under advisement, but that if the offeror 
desires to close a bargain at once the offeree makes a specific counter -offer.  Such an answer will not 
extend the time that the original offer remains open, but will not cut that time short.  Compare § 38. Illustration: 
3.  A makes the same offer to B as that stated in Illustration 1.  B replies, "I am  keeping your offer 
under advisement, but if you wish to close the matter at once I will give you $ 4,800." A does not 
reply, and within the thirty -day period B accepts the original offer.  B's acceptance is effective.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 40 Time When Rejection or Counter -Offer Terminates the Power of Acceptance   
 
Rejection or counter -offer  by mail or telegram does not terminate the power of acceptance until 
received by the offeror, but limits the power so that a letter or telegram of acceptance started 
after the sending of an otherwise effective rejection or counter- offer is only a counter -offer 
unless the acceptance is received by the offeror before he receives the rejection or counter- offer.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Receipt essential .  A rejection terminates the offeree's power of acceptance because of the 
probability of reli ance by the offeror, and there is no possibility of reliance until the rejection is 
received.  See § 38.  Hence the power continues until receipt.  The same rule is applied by analogy to a counter- offer, although the reason is somewhat different: a counter -offer cannot be taken under 
consideration as a substitute proposal until it is received.  See § 39.  As to when a rejection is received, see § 68; compare Restatement, Second, Agency §§ 268- 83, Uniform Commercial Code § 1-201(25) 
to (27). b.  Subsequent acceptance.  Since a rejection or counter -offer is not effective until received, it may 
until that time be superseded by an acceptance.  But the probability remains that the offeror will rely on the rejection or counter -offer if it is received before the ac ceptance.  To protect the offeror in such 
reliance, the offeree who has dispatched a rejection is deprived of the benefit of the rule that an acceptance may take effect on dispatch (§ 63).  The rule of this Section only applies, however, to a rejection or counter- offer which is otherwise effective.  A rejection or counter -offer may be denied 
effect to terminate the power of acceptance if the original offer is itself a contract or if the offeror or offeree manifests an intention that the power continue.  See  §§ 37- 39.  Similarly, a purported rejection 
or counter -offer dispatched after an effective acceptance is in effect a revocation of acceptance, 
governed by § 63 rather than by this Section. Illustration: 
1.  A makes B an offer by mail.  B immediately after  receiving the offer mails a letter of rejection.  
Within the time permitted by the offer B accepts.  This acceptance creates a contract only if received 
before the rejection, or if the power of acceptance continues under §§ 37- 39.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 41 Lapse of Time   
 
(1)  An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated at the time specified in the offer, or, if no 
time is specified, at the  end of a reasonable time.  
(2)  What is a reasonable time is a question of fact, depending on all the circumstances existing when the offer and attempted acceptance are made.  
(3)  Unless otherwise indicated by the language or the circumstances, and subject  to the rule 
stated in § 49, an offer sent by mail is seasonably accepted if an acceptance is mailed at any time before midnight on the day on which the offer is received.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Specified time .  Just as the offer may prescr ibe the identity of the offeree (§ 29) or the form of 
acceptance (§ 30), so it may prescribe a time limit for acceptance.  Such a limitation must be complied with.  See § 60.  In cases of misunderstanding, the principles underlying § 20 are applicable.  Se e 
Chapter 9. b.  Reasonable time .  In the absence of a contrary indication, just as acceptance may be made in any 
manner and by any medium which is reasonable in the circumstances (§ 30), so it may be made at any time which is reasonable in the circumstances.  The circumstances to be considered have a wide range: they include the nature of the proposed contract, the purposes of the parties, the course of dealing between them, and any relevant usages of trade.  In general, the question is what time would be thought satisfactory to the offeror by a reasonable man in the position of the offeree; but circumstances not known to the offeree may be relevant to show that the time actually taken by the offeree was satisfactory to the offeror.  See Illustration 6 to §  23. 
c.  Time for acceptance by act; rewards .  Where the offeree is invited to accept by performing or 
refraining from performing an act, a reasonable time for so doing is ordinarily a reasonable time for accepting.  But the purposes of the offeror, if the  offeree knows or has reason to know of them, must 
also be taken into account.  Thus an offer of reward for the capture of the person guilty of a specific crime cannot ordinarily be accepted after the statute of limitations has barred prosecution.  
Illustra tions:  
1.  A publishes an offer of reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person guilty of a specified murder.  B, intending to obtain the reward, gives the requested information a year after the publication of the offer.  The a cceptance is timely.  
2.  After a series of incendiary attempts, a city publishes each day for a week an offer of reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any person who shall set fire to any building within 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 41  
 josh glen  Page 119 of 189 the city.  The responsible city officials serve for one year terms.  A fire set three years after the last 
publication is not within the terms of the offer. 
3.  A bank posts in its office an offer of reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
any person who robs any bank which is a member of an association of banks in the same county.  After several years the poster is removed.  A robbery three years after the removal may be found to be within the terms of the offer.  
d.  Direct negotiati ons.  Where the parties bargain face to face or over the telephone, the time for 
acceptance does not ordinarily extend beyond the end of the conversation unless a contrary intention is indicated.  A contrary intention may be indicated either by express wor ds or by the circumstances.  
For example, the delivery of a written offer to the offeree, or an expectation that some action will be taken before acceptance, may indicate that a delayed acceptance is invited.  
Illustration: 
4.  While A and B are engaged in conversation, A makes B an offer to which B then makes no reply, 
out on meeting A again a few hours later B states that he accepts the offer.  There is no contract unless the offer or the circumstances indicate that the offer is intended to continue beyond the immediate 
conversation. e.  Offers made by mail or telegram .  Where the parties are at a distance from each other, the normal 
understanding is that the time for acceptance is extended at least by the normal time for transmission of the offer and for the sending of the offeree's reply.  Compare § 49.  Subsection (3) reflects the normal understanding that mail is promptly answered if a reply is mailed at any time on the day of receipt.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code §§ 4 -301, 4 -302, fixing the time for  settlement by a 
bank for demand items.  But in the absence of a significant speculative element in the situation, a considerably longer time may be reasonable.  The fact that an offer is made by telegram or mailgram may or may not indicate that the time f or reply is shorter than it would be if the mail were used.  
Compare § 65. Illustration: 
5.  A makes B an offer by mail to sell goods.  B receives the offer at the close of business hours and 
accepts it by letter promptly the next morning.  The acceptance is timely.  
f.  Speculative transactions .  The rule that an offer becomes irrevocable when an acceptance is mailed 
(§§ 42, 63) in effect imposes a risk of commitment on the offeror during the period required for communication of the acceptance, although during that period the offeror has no assurance that the bargain has been concluded.  The rule that the power of acceptance is terminated by the lapse of a reasonable time serves to limit this risk.  The more significant the risk, the greater is the need for limitation, and hence the shorter is the time which is reasonable.  
These considerations have their principal application in the sale of property which may be subject to rapid fluctuation in value, such as commodities, securities or land.  The value of such property, however, may be stable for substantial periods of time, particularly in the case of land.  Absence of actual fluctuation during the period before acceptance is a factor tending to indicate that acceptance occurred within a reasonable time.  Similarly, delay in acceptance of an offer to insure may not be unreasonable if there is no change in the risk or in the applicable insurance rates.  
The reasonable time for acceptance in a speculative transaction is brief not only because the offeror does not ordinarily intend to assume an extended risk without compensation but also because he does not intend to give the offeree an extended opportunity for speculation at the offeror's expense.  If the offeree makes use for speculative purposes of time allowed for communication, there may be a lack of 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 41  
 josh glen  Page 120 of 189 good faith, and an acceptance may not be timely even though it arrives within the time contemplated 
by the offeror.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code §§ 1-203, 2-103. Illustrations:  
6.  A sends B an offer by mail to sell a piece of farm land.  B does not reply for three days and then mails an acceptance.  It is a question of fact under the circumstances of the particular case whether the delay is unreasonable.  
7.  A sends B a telegraphic offer to sell oil which at the  time is subject to rapid fluctuations in price.  
The offer is received near the close of business hours, and a telegraphic acceptance is sent the next day, after the offeree has learned of a sharp price rise.  The acceptance is too late if a fixed price w as 
offered, but may be timely if the price is market price at time of delivery.  
8.  A sends B an offer by mail to sell at a fixed price corporate stock not listed on an exchange.  B waits two days after receiving the offer and then sends a telegraphic acceptance after learning of a sharp rise in the price bid over -the- counter.  The acceptance may be too late even though it arrives 
before a prompt acceptance by mail would have arrived.

eleven months later could have been reasonably understood to continue the offer.  Because lengthy negotiations over the collateral claim were begun by the subcontractor, the amount of the main claim was conceded,  and time was not of the essence, the court found that two and one -half years from the 
original offer to the resolution of the collateral claim was not per se an unreasonable period of delay and did not cause the offer to lapse.  See also § 45.

Comment:  
a.  Revocability of offers .  Most offers are revocable. Revocability may rest on the express or implied 
terms of the offer, as in the case of bids at an auction.  See § 28.  But the ordinary offer is revocable 
even though it expressly states the contrary, because of the doctrine that an informal agreement is binding as a bargain only if supported by consideration.  Inroads have been made  on that doctrine by 
statute and by rules giving effect to nominal consideration and to action in reliance on a promise.  Where such rules are applicable, or where the offer is itself a formal contract or an agreement binding as a bargain, the case is governed by § 37 rather than by this Section.  See § 25. Illustration: 
1.  A makes a written offer to B to sell him a piece of land.  The offer states that it will remain open 
for thirty days and is not subject to countermand.  The next day A orally informs B that the offer is terminated.  B's power of acceptance is terminated unless the offer is a contract under § 25.  
b.  Necessity that communication be received .  An offeror may reserve the power to revoke the offer 
without notice, and such a reservation will be given effect whether contained in the offer or in a later communication received by the offeree before a contract is created.  But such a reservation is unusual; it deprives the offeree of a dependable basis for decision whether to accept and greatly im pairs the 
usefulness of the offer.  In the absence of such a reservation, the offeree is justified in relying on the offeror's manifested intention regardless of any undisclosed change in the offeror's state of mind.  As to when a revocation is received by  the offeree, see § 68; compare Restatement, Second, Agency §§ 
268-83, Uniform Commercial Code § 1- 201(25) to (27).  
c.  Purported revocation after acceptance .  Once the offeree has exercised his power to create a 
contract by accepting the offer, a purporte d revocation is ineffective as such.  Where an acceptance by 
mail is effective on dispatch, for example, it is not deprived of effect by a revocation subsequently received by the offeree.  See § 63.  But the revocation may have effect, depending on its ter ms, as a 
failure of condition discharging the offeree's duty of performance, as a breach by anticipatory repudiation, or as an offer to modify or rescind the contract. Illustrations:  
2.  A sends B an offer by mail to buy a piece of land for $ 5000.  The ne xt day A sends B a letter 
stating that unless B has already accepted A revokes the offer and makes a new offer to buy the same land for $ 4800.  B receives A's second letter after he has duly mailed a letter of acceptance, but 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 42  
 josh glen  Page 123 of 189 promptly sells the land to C without further communication with A.  The sale is a breach of contract 
by B. 
3.  A sends B an offer by mail to buy a piece of land.  The next day A sends B a letter stating that A 
has changed his mind and will not buy the land even if B has already accept ed the offer.  B receives 
A's second letter after he has duly mailed a letter of acceptance, but promptly sells the land to C.  B's duty of performance is discharged.  See Comment a to § 283. d.  What constitutes revocation .  The word "revoke" is not essential to a revocation.  Any clear 
manifestation of unwillingness to enter into the proposed bargain is sufficient.  Thus a statement that property offered for sale has been otherwise disposed of is a revocation.  But equivocal language may not be sufficient. Illustrations:  
4.  A makes an offer to buy goods from B, and later requests B not to deliver the goods until A is in a better condition to handle them.  The request does not revoke the offer. 
5.  A makes an offer to B, and later says to B, "Well, I don't  know if we are ready.  We have not 
decided, we might not want to go through with it." The offer is revoked.

§ 43 Indirect Communication of Revocation   
 
An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated when the offeror takes definite action 
inconsistent with an intention to enter into the proposed contract and the offeree acquires reliable information to that effect.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Direct and indirect communication.  This Section extends the principle giving effect to a revocation communicated directly by the offeror to the offeree, and is subject to the same qualifications.  See § 42.  Thus a revocation is ineffective, whether communication is direct or indirect, if the offer is itself a contract, or after the power of acceptance has been duly exercised.  On 
the other hand, no communication at all is necessary for revocation if the offer so provides.  Where a revocation is communicated through a person or persons having power to act for the offeror or offeree, the case is governed by § 42, supplemented by the law of agency. 
b.  Sale of land.  The rule of this Section has been applied most frequently to offers for the sale of an interest in land.  If the offeror, after making such an offer, sells or contracts to sell the interest to another person than the offeree, his act manifests an intention not to perform in accordance with the offer and creates a probable inability to perform.  Compare the rules on vendor's prospective inability in §§ 250- 52.  Moreover, the other person has title to the land or a right to specific performance prior 
to any right of the offeree, and interference by the offeree with the rights of the other person may be tortious.  See Restatement, Second, Torts §§ 766, 773.  An agreement in derogation of  those rights 
may be unenforceable as against public policy.  See §§ 192, 194. Illustration: 
1.  A offers a parcel of land to B at a stated price, and gives B a week in which to consider the 
proposal.  Within the week A contracts to sell the parcel to C, and B is informed of that fact by a tenant of the premises.  B nevertheless sends a formal acceptance which is received by A within the week.  There is no contract between A and B.  
c.  Other transactions .  The considerations applicable to offers to sell land are equally applicable to 
offers to sell other specific property, if the offeror enters into a transaction which confers on a third person rights prior to those of the offeree.  But the rule stated is not limited to such cases.  Nor is this Section an exhaustive statement of the circumstances under which indirect communication may result in termination of the offeree's power of acceptance.  Compare, e.g., §§ 20, 153 on the effect of the offeree's acquisition of knowledge of a misunderstanding or mistake. Illustration: 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 43  
 josh glen  Page 125 of 189 2.  A offers to employ B to replace C, an employee of A who has given A a month's notice of intention 
to quit.  A gives B a week to consider the proposal.  C changes his mind and makes a contract with A for continued employment for a year.  B  asks C about his duties, and C informs B of the new contract.  
B immediately mails a letter of acceptance to A, which arrives within the week allowed for acceptance.  There is no contract between A and B.  
d.  Definite action; reliable information .  This Section does not apply to cases where the offeror takes 
no action or takes equivocal action.  Thus mere negotiations with a third person, or even a definite offer to a second offeree, may be consistent with an intention on the part of the offeror to honor an acceptance by the original offeree.  Even a binding contract with a third person may be expressly subject to any rights arising under the outstanding offer.  Moreover, a mere rumor does not terminate the power of acceptance, if the offeree disbe lieves it and is reasonable in doing so, even though the 
rumor is later verified.  The basic standard to which the offeree is held is that of a reasonable person acting in good faith. Illustration: 
3.  A offers to sell B a hundred shares of stock at a fixe d price, and states that the offer will not be 
revoked for a week.  Within the week C offers A a higher price for the same stock, and B learns of the 
higher offer.  B's power of acceptance is not terminated, since he is entitled to assume that A will honor his commitment regardless of its legal effect.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 44 Effect of Deposit on Revocability of Offer   
 
An offeror's power of revocation is not limited by the deposit of money or other property to be 
forfeited in the event of revocation, but the deposit may be forfeited to the extent that it is not a penalty.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Deposits .  Money or other property is often transferred by an offeror to the account of the offeree, 
and such property may ordinarily be recovered if the offer is not accepted.  See Restatement of Restitution § 56.  If it is agreed that the property may be forfeited in the event of  revocation of the 
offer, the agreement is subject to the rules governing liquidated damages and penalties.  See § 356; Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 718.  The agreement may be valid as a provision for liquidated 
damages, or as a provision of security for the payment of actual damages.  In either case, the offer is treated as irrevocable for the purpose of determining rights in the deposit, but the offeror's power of revocation is not otherwise impaired.  In cases of bids on government contracts, statutes oft en 
authorize forfeiture without regard to the distinction between liquidated damages and penalty. Illustration: 
1.  A offers to buy Blackacre from B for $ 10,000 and deposits $ 500 to be forfeited in the event of 
revocation.  A revokes the offer before acceptance, and the market value of the land at the time for conveyance fixed in the offer is $ 9,000.  B's power of acceptance is terminated, but B may retain the $ 500.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 45 Option Contract Created by Part Performance or Tender   
 
(1)  Where an offer invites an offeree to accept by rendering a performance and does not invite a 
promissory acceptance, an option contract is created when the offeree tenders or begins the invited performance or tenders a beginning of it.  
(2)  The offeror's duty of performance under any option contract so created is conditional on completion or tender of the invited performance in accordance with the terms of the offer.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Offer limited to acceptance by performance only .  This Section is limited to cases where the offer 
does not invite a promissory acceptance.  Such an offer has often been referred to as an "offer for a unilateral contract." Typical illustrations are found in offers of rewards or prizes and in non-commer cial arrangements among relatives and friends.  See Comment b to § 32.  As to analogous 
cases arising under offers which give the offeree power to accept either by performing or by promising to perform, as he chooses, see §§ 32, 62. b.  Manifestation of contrary intention .  The rule of this Section is designed to protect the offeree in 
justifiable reliance on the offeror's promise, and the rule yields to a manifestation of intention which makes reliance unjustified.  A reservation of power to revoke after performance has begun means that as yet there is no promise and no offer.  See §§ 2, 24.  In particular, if the performance is one which requires the cooperation of both parties, such as the payment of money or the manual delivery of goods, a person who res erves the right to refuse to receive the performance has not made an offer.  See 
§ 26. Illustrations:  
1.  B owes A $ 5000 payable in installments over a five -year period.  A proposes that B discharge the 
debt by paying $ 4,500 cash within one month, but reserves the right to refuse any such payment.  A has not made an offer.  A tender by B in accordance with the proposal is an offer by B. 
2.  A, an insurance company, issues a bulletin to its agents, entitled "Extra Earnings Agreement," 
providing for annual bonus payments to the agents varying according to "monthly premiums in force" and "lapse ratio," but reserving the right to change or discontinue the bonus, individually or collectively, with or without notice, at any time before payment.  There is no offe r or promise.  
c.  Tender of performance.  A proposal to receive a payment of money or a delivery of goods is an 
offer only if acceptance can be completed without further cooperation by the offeror.  If there is an offer, it follows that acceptance must be complete at the latest when performance is tendered.  A 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 45  
 josh glen  Page 129 of 189 tender of performance, so bargained for and given in exchange for the offer, ordinarily furnishes 
consideration and creates a contract.  See §§ 17, 71, 72. 
This is so whether or not the tender carries with it any incidental promises.  See §§ 54, 62.  If no 
commitment is made by the offeree, the contract is an option contract.  See § 25. 
Illustration: 
3.  A promises B to sell him a specified chattel for $ 5, stating that B is not to be bound until he pa ys 
the money.  B tenders $ 5 within a reasonable time, but A refuses to accept the tender.  There is a 
breach of contract.  
d.  Beginning to perform .  If the invited performance takes time, the invitation to perform necessarily 
includes an invitation to begin performance.  In most such cases the beginning of performance carries with it an express or implied promise to complete performance.  See § 62.  In the less common case where the offer does not contemplate or invite a promise by the offeree, the beginning of performance nevertheless completes the manifestation of mutual assent and furnishes consideration for an option contract.  See § 25.  If the beginning of performance requires the cooperation of the offeror, tender of part performance has the same eff ect.  Part performance or tender may also create an option contract 
in a situation where the offeree is invited to take up the option by making a promise, if the offer invites a preliminary performance before the time for the offeree's final commitment.  
Illustrations:  
4.  A offers a reward for the return of lost property.  In response to the offer, B searches for the property and finds it.  A then notifies B that the offer is revoked.  B makes a tender of the property to A conditional on payment of the rewa rd, and A refuses.  There is a breach of contract by A.  
5.  A, a magazine, offers prizes in a subscription contest.  At a time when B has submitted the largest number of subscriptions, A cancels the contest.  A has broken its contract with B. 
6.  A writes to her daughter B, living in another state, an offer to leave A's farm to B if B gives up her 
home and cares for A during A's life, B remaining free to terminate the arrangement at any time.  B gives up her home, moves to A's farm, and begins caring for A.  A is bound by an option contract. 
7.  A offers to sell a piece of land to B, and promises that if B incurs expense in employing experts to 
appraise the property the offer will be irrevocable for 30 days.  B hires experts and pays for their transportation  to the land.  A is bound by an option contract. 
8.  In January A, an employer, publishes a notice to his employees, promising a stated Christmas bonus to any employee who is continuously in A's employ from January to Christmas.  B, an employee hired by the week, reads the notice and continues at work beyond the expiration of the current week.  A is bound by an option contract, and if B is continuously in A's employ until Christmas a notice of revocation of the bonus is ineffective.  
e.  Completion of perfor mance .  Where part performance or tender by the offeree creates an option 
contract, the offeree is not bound to complete performance.  The offeror alone is bound, but his duty of performance is conditional on completion of the offeree's performance.  If the offeree abandons performance, the offeror's duty to perform never arises.  See § 224, defining "condition," and Illustration 4 to that Section.  But the condition may be excused, for example, if the offeror prevents performance, waives it, or repudiates.   See Comment b to § 225 and §§ 239, 278. 
f.  Preparations for performance .  What is begun or tendered must be part of the actual performance 
invited in order to preclude revocation under this Section.  Beginning preparations, though they may be essential to carrying out the contract or to accepting the offer, is not enough.  Pr eparations to 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 45  
 josh glen  Page 130 of 189 perform may, however, constitute justifiable reliance sufficient to make the offeror's promise binding 
under § 87(2). 
In many cases what is invited depends on what is a reasonable mode of acceptance.  See § 30.  The 
distinction between prepar ing for performance and beginning performance in such cases may turn on 
many factors: the extent to which the offeree's conduct is clearly referable to the offer, the definite and substantial character of that conduct, and the extent to which it is of actu al or prospective benefit to 
the offeror rather than the offeree, as well as the terms of the communications between the parties, their prior course of dealing, and any relevant usages of trade. Illustration: 
9.  A makes a written promise to pay $ 5000 to B, a hospital, "to aid B in its humanitarian work." 
Relying upon this and other like promises, B proceeds in its humanitarian work, expending large sums of money and incurring large liabilities.  Performance by B has begun, and A's offer is irrevocable. g.  Agency contracts.  This Section frequently applies to agency arrangements, particularly offers made to real estate brokers.  Sometimes there is a return promise by the agent, particularly if there is an agreement for exclusive dealing, since such an agreement normally imposes an obligation on the agent to use best efforts.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 306(2); compare Restatement, Second, 
Agency § 378.  In other cases the agent does not promise to act, but the principal must compensate him if he does act.  The rules governing the principal's duty of compensation are stated in detail in Chapter 14 of the Restatement, Second, Agency, particularly §§ 443-57.

§ 46 Revocation of General Offer   
 
Where an offer is made by advertisement in a newspaper or other general notification to the 
public or t o a number of persons whose identity is unknown to the offeror, the offeree's power of 
acceptance is terminated when a notice of termination is given publicity by advertisement or other general notification equal to that given to the offer and no better means of notification is reasonably available.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Revocability .  This Section is an extension of the principle giving effect to a communicated 
revocation, and is subject to the same limitations.  See § 42; compare § 43.  Theoretically, a general 
offer may be made irrevocable under §§ 25 and 37 in the same ways as any other offer, but irrevocable offers to a number of unidentified persons are rare except where such documents as letters of credit are issued.  See Illustration 2 to § 29.  An irrevocable offer, or a revocable offer which has been duly accepted, cannot of course be revoked under this Section.  On the other hand, this Section does not exclude revocati on under § 42 or § 43 or under a power to revoke expressly reserved in the offer; a 
published notice of revocation which does not comply with this Section is nonetheless effective as to an offeree who actually learns of it.  
b.  Available means of notice .  The rule of this Section reconciles the principle that an offer is 
ordinarily revocable with the fact that general publication is not a reliable means of informing offerees of the revocation of an offer.  Revocation by a notification not actually received is given effect only where such revocation is provided for in the offer or where the alternative is that the offer is as a practical matter irrevocable.  Where a feasible and customary substitute is available which is better calculated to produce actual receipt of notice, newspaper publication is not enough.  Even where publication is the only or the best available means of giving notice, it may not be effective immediately.  There must be publicity equivalent to that given the offer, including in appropria te cases 
a reasonable time for equivalent indirect circulation.  Compare Illustration 1 to § 23.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A, a newspaper, publishes an offer of prizes to the persons who procure the largest number of subscriptions as evidenced by cash or checks received by a specified time.  B completes and mails an entry blank giving his name and address, which is received by A.  Thereafter, during the contest, A publishes a notice that personal checks will not be counted; B does not see the notice.  Unless the original offer provided otherwise, B is not bound by the later notice, since A could have given B personal notice.

Seven months later the President publishes a proclamation revoking the offer, which is given the same

contract.

§ 47 Revocation of Divisible Offer   
 
An offer contemplating a series of independent contracts by separate acceptances may be 
effectively revoked so as to terminate the  power to create future contracts, though one or more 
of the proposed contracts have already been formed by the offeree's acceptance.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Divisible offers .  An offer may propose several contracts, to arise at different times; typical 
examples are continuing guaranties and standing offers for the sale of goods.  See § 31 and Comment.  Such an offer is divisible, and the power to make an effective revocation continues pari passu with the continuing power of the offeree to accept.  Compare §§ 33- 34. 
Illustrations:  
1.  A offers to guarantee the payment of all bills of exchange drawn by B and discounted by C.  C discounts one such bill.  A is bound to pay it.  A then notifies C that the guaranty is withdrawn.  A is not bound to pay bills subsequently discounted. 
2.  A offers B to sell him five tons of steel daily, and tenders five tons at once.  B accepts the tender.  
The same amount is furnished daily for a number of days.  A then states to B that he revokes the offer.  A contract is formed each day that steel is furnished, but the revocation prevents the formation of any contracts thereafter.  
b.  Acceptance by beginning performance .  Ordinarily an offer invites acceptance in any manner 
which is reasonable under the circumstances, and rendering a requested performance is often a reasonable mode of acceptance.  See §§ 30, 32.  Where performance takes time, the beginning of performance may be a reasonable mode of acceptance, and the offer may then become irrevocable, whether or not the offeree's action constitutes a promise to complete performance.  See §§ 45, 62.  These principles apply to divisible offers, but the beginning of performance of one contract of the contemplated series makes irrevocable only the offer for that one.  S ee § 50. 
c.  Divisible option contracts .  It is possible to make a divisible offer irrevocable, not just as to the 
contracts already formed by acceptances, but also as to the power to create future contracts.  An irrevocable divisible offer is in effect a series of binding option contracts, but all may be made binding by a single consideration or a single formal document. Illustration: 
3.  A offers to buy from B at the market price 100 tons of steel per month for the next 12 months, 
promising that in consideration of the delivery of the first installment B is to have an option to sell any or all of the other eleven installments.  B delivers the first 100 tons as requested.  There is an irrevocable offer to buy the eleven undelivered installments.

Topic 4 - Duration of the Offeree’s Power of Acceptance  
 
§ 48 Death or Incapacity of Offeror or Offeree   
 
An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated when the offeree or offeror dies or is deprived of 
legal capacity to enter into the proposed contract.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Death of offeror .  The offeror's death terminates the power of the offeree without notice to him.  
This rule seems to be a relic of the obsolete view that a contr act requires a "meeting of minds," and it 
is out of harmony with the modern doctrine that a manifestation of assent is effective without regard to actual mental assent.  See § 19.  Some inroads have been made on the rule by statutes and decisions with resp ect to bank deposits and collections, and by legislation with respect to powers of attorney 
given by servicemen.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 4 -405; Restatement, Second, Agency § 120 
and Comment a.  In the absence of legislation, the rule remains in effe ct.  See also Restatement of 
Security § 87. b.  Incapacity of offeror .  The common types of incapacity and their effects are indicated in the 
Comment to § 12.  The offeror's permanent lack of capacity to enter into a contract terminates the offeree's power  of acceptance in the same manner as the offeror's death.  Compare Restatement, 
Second, Agency §§ 122, 133; Restatement of Security § 84.  But persons under a disability often have power to enter into voidable contracts.  See § 7 and Comment; §§ 12-16. c.  Death or incapacity of offeree .  Only the offeree can accept an offer which is not also a contract.  
See § 52.  When the offeree dies or lacks capacity, therefore, acceptance is impossible.  Compare Comment b to § 36.  By the terms of the offer, however, the personal representative or distributee of 
the offeree may be made an additional offeree.  
d.  Option contracts .  The rule stated in this Section does not affect option contracts.  See § 37.  But 
the death or incapacity of one of the parties may discharge any contractual duty by reason of failure of consideration, frustration, impossibility or failure of condition.  See § 36 and Comment.

§ 49 Effect of Delay in Communication of Offer   
 
If communication of an offer to the offeree is delayed, the period within which a contract can be 
created by acceptance is not thereby extended if the offeree knows or has reason to know of the delay, though it is due to the fault of the offeror; but if the delay is due to the fault of the offeror or to the means of transmission adopted by him, and the offeree ne ither knows nor has reason to 
know that there has been delay, a contract can be created by acceptance within the period which would have been permissible if the offer had beendispatched at the time that its arrival seems to indicate.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Illustration: 
1.  A sends B a misdirected offer which is delayed in delivery, as is apparent from the date of the letter 
or the postmark on the envelope, so that the offeree does not receive the offer until some time later than he  would have received it had the direction been correct.  The offeree cannot accept the offer 
unless he can do so within the time which would have been permissible had the offer arrived seasonably.

Restatement of the Law, Contracts 2d - Official Text  >  Chapter 3 - Formation of  Contracts -- Mutual Assent  >  
Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 50 Acceptance of Offer Defined; Acceptance by Performance; Acceptance by 
Promise   
 
(1)  Acceptance of an offer is a manifestation of assent to the terms thereof made by the offeree 
in a manner invited or required by the offer.  
(2)  Acceptance by performance requires that at least part of what the offer requests be performed or tendered and includes acceptance by a performance which operates as a return promise.  
(3)  Acceptance by a promise requires that the offeree complete every act essential to the making of the promise.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Mode of acceptance .  The acceptance must manifest assent to the same bargain proposed by the 
offer, and must also comply with the terms of the offer as to the identity of the offeree and the mode of manifesting acceptance.  Offers commonly invite acceptance in any reasonable manner, but a particular mode of acceptance may be required.  See § 30.  In case of doubt, the offeree may choose to accept either by promising or by rendering the requested performance.  See § 32. b.  Acceptance by performance.  Where the offer requires acceptance by performance and does not 
invite a return promise, as in the ordinary case of an offer of a reward , a contract can be created only 
by the offeree's performance.  See Comment b to § 32.  In such cases the act requested and performed 
as consideration for the offeror's promise ordinarily also constitutes acceptance; under § 45 the beginning of performance  or the tender of part performance of what is requested may both indicate 
assent and furnish consideration for an option contract.  In some other cases the offeree may choose to create a contract either by making a promise or by rendering or tendering performance; in most such cases the beginning of performance or a tender of part performance operates as a promise to render complete performance.  See §§ 32, 62.  Mere preparation to perform, however, is not acceptance, although in some cases preparation may make the offeror's promise binding under § 87(2). Illustrations:  
1.  A, who is about to leave on a month's vacation, tells B that A will pay B $ 50 if B will paint A's porch while A is away.  B says he may not have time, and A says B may decide after A leaves.  If B begins the painting, there is an acceptance by performance which operates as a promise to complete the job.  See §§ 32, 62. 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 50  
 josh glen  Page 140 of 189 2.  In Illustration 1, B also expresses doubt whether he will be able to finish the job, and it is agreed 
that B may quit at any time but will be paid only if he finishes the job during A's vacation.  If B begins the painting, there is an acceptance by performance creating an option contract.  See § 45. c.  Acceptance by promise.  The typical contract consists of mutual promises and is formed by an 
acceptance constituting a return promise by the offeree.  A promissory acceptance may be explicitly required by the offer, or may be the only type of acceptance which is reasonable under the circumstances, or the offeree may choose to accept by promise an offer which invites acceptance either by promise or by performance.  See §§ 30, 32.  The promise may be made in words or other symbols of assent, or it may be implied from conduct, other than acts of performance, provided only that it is in a form invited or required by the offer.  An act of performance may also operate as a return 
promise, but the acceptance in such a case is treated as an acceptance by performance rather than an acceptance by promise; thus the requirement of no tification is governed by § 54 rather than by § 56.  
As appears from § 63, acceptance by promise may be effective when a written promise is started on its way, but the offeree must complete the acts necessary on his part to constitute a promise by him.  Similarly, in cases where communication to the offeror is unnecessary under § 69, the acts constituting 
the promise must be complete.  
Illustrations:  
3.  A sends to B plans for a summer cottage to be built on A's land in a remote wilderness area, and writes, "If you will undertake to build a cottage in accordance with the enclosed plans, I will pay you $ 5,000." B cannot accept by beginning or completing performance, since A's letter calls for acceptance by promise.  See § 58. 
4.  A mails a written order to B,  offering to buy on specified terms a machine of a type which B 
regularly sells from stock.  The order provides, "Ship at once." B immediately mails a letter of 
acceptance.  This is an acceptance by promise, even though under § 32 B might have accepted by performance. 
5.  A gives an order to B Company's traveling salesman which provides, "This proposal becomes a 
contract without further notification when approval by an executive officer of B Company is noted hereon at its home office." The notation of approval is an acceptance by promise.  See §§ 56, 69 as to the requirement of notification.

§ 51 Effect of Part Performance Without Knowledge of Offer   
 
Unless the offeror manifests a contrary intention, an offeree who learns of an offer after he has 
rendered part of the performance requested by the offer may accept by completing the requested performance.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Performance without knowledge .  Where an offer invites a return promise, the offeree may 
manifest assent and thereby make a return promise even though he does not have actual knowledge of the offer.  See § 23 Comment c ; § 69.  But when an offer contemplates no commitment, as in cases of 
offers of reward, it is ordinarily essential to the acceptance of the offer that the offeree know of the proposal made.  In general, performance completed before the offer comes to the offeree's knowledge does not have reference to the offer, and the terms of the offer are not satisfied by such action.  See §§ 23, 71. b.  Completion of performance with knowledge .  Where part performance has been rendered by a 
person ignorant of the existence of an offer, the offer can no longer serve the purpose of inducing that performance.  But it can induce the completion of performance.  It is commonly intended by the offeror to have that effect and so understood by the offeree.  The inference that the offeror so intends is strengthened when the part performance is valueless to him unless completed, or when the offeror knows of the offeree's continuing performance and fails to revoke.  In the absence of contrary indications, the law gives effect to the common understanding.  But there may be no consideration if the off eree is under a legal duty to the offeror to complete the performance.  See § 73.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A offers a reward for the apprehension and delivery into police custody of a criminal.  Before learning of the reward, B arrests the criminal.  After learn ing of the reward, B delivers the criminal 
into police custody.  B is entitled to the reward. 
2.  A posts a notice on his bulletin board offering a specified bonus to any employee who remains in 
A's employment for four months.  B, one of the employees, continues to work for one month before learning of the offer.  Thereafter, B completes the four -month period of employment.  B is entitled to 
the bonus.

Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 52 Who May Accept an Offer   
 
An offer can be accepted only by a person whom it invites to furnish the consideration.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  This Section states a negative fairly implied in § 29.  The offeror is the master of his 
offer, and the power of acceptance rests on his manifested intention.  The rule that the power of 
acceptance is personal to the offeree is applied strictly, even in cases where the offeree after acceptance could assign his rights and delegate performance to the assignee under §§ 317(2) and 318(1).  As to death of the offeree, compare § 37 with § 48. Illustrations:  
1.  A makes an offer to B, who dies after receiving it.  His executor, though acting within the permitted time, cannot accept.  
2.  A offers to guarantee payment for goods delivered to B by C.  D cannot accept by delivering goods to B.  
b.  Identity of the offeree.  Just as the person to whom a promise is addressed is the promisee (§ 2), so the person to whom an offer is addressed is the offeree.  An offer which is itself a promise may contemplate the furnishing of consideration by a person other than the promisee.  See § 71(4).  That other person is then the offeree.  
In case of misunderstanding as to identity of the offeree, the principles stated in § 20 are applicable.  An offeror who knows or has reason to know that he is apparently making an offer to a particular person may be bound by that appearance.  But one who knows that he is not the intended offeree cannot take advantage of such an appearance, and one who has reason to know the offeror's meaning can accept only if the offeror in fact knows of the offeree's contrary understanding. Illustrations:  
3.  A promises B that A will sel l and deliver a set of books to B if B's father C will promise to pay $ 
150 for the set.  B is the promisee of A's promise; C is the offeree of A's offer.  Only C can accept the offer by making the return promise invited by A. 
4.  A sends B an order for goods.  C, from whom A has previously refused to buy such goods, has 
purchased B's business.  Without notifying A of the change of proprietorship, C ships the goods as ordered.  Neither B nor C has accepted A's offer.  
5.  A, in Illustration 4, before using the goods, discovers that they have come from C.  A's retention or use of them is an acceptance of an offer from C, and a contract arises.  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 52  
 josh glen  Page 145 of 189 c.  Agency .  The rules stated in the Restatement of this Subject are supplemented by the law of agency, 
and in the abs ence of contrary statement it is assumed that any necessary act may be performed on 
behalf of a contracting party by his agent.  Thus an offer may be accepted by an agent of the offeree.  
See Restatement, Second, Agency § 292.  Even an acceptance by a purported agent, acting without agency power, may in appropriate cases be ratified by the offeree.  See Restatement, Second, Agency §§ 82- 104.  Ratification must occur, however, before the offeror manifests withdrawal from the 
transaction and before the termin ation of the offeree's power of acceptance.  See Restatement, Second, 
Agency § 88. 
Under the law of agency, an offeree who purports to act on his own behalf may in fact be acting for an 
undisclosed principal, and the undisclosed principal may be bound by the contract and may have rights under it.  See Restatement, Second, Agency §§ 186 Comment a, 302- 10, 372. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is based on former § 54.  That Section permitted acceptance "for the benefit of" the offeree.  As is explained in Comment b, the quoted phrase was misleading; it is omitted because in 
such cases the acceptor must be an offeree.  See 1 Williston, Contracts § 80 (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts § 56 (1963).

§ 53 Acceptance by Performance; Manifestation of Intention Not to Accept   
 
(1)  An offer can be accepted by the rendering of a performance only if the offer invites such an 
acceptance.  
(2)  Except as stated in § 69, the rendering of a performance does not constitute an acceptance if within a reasonable time the offeree exercises reasonable diligence to notify the offeror of non -
acceptance.  
(3)  Where an offer of a promise invites acceptance by performance and does not invite a promissory acceptance, the rendering of the invited performance does not constitute an acceptance if before the offeror performs his promise the offeree manifests an intention not to accept.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Invitation of acceptance by performance .  Subsection (1) makes explicit with respect to acceptance 
by performance the offeror's power to control the mode of acceptance.  See §§ 30(1), 50(1).  In the absence of contrary indication, the question is whether acceptance by performance is reasonable under the circumstances.  See § 30(2).  Where either acceptance by performance or acceptance by promise is reasonable, the offeree may choose between them.  Where no return commitment is invited and the invited performance takes time, the beginning of performance creates an option contract.  See § 45.  In other cases the beginning of performance may carry with it a promise to complete performance.  See § 62. b.  Rejection by the performing offeree.  Subsection (2) states the power of the offeree to reject a n 
offer even though he engages in conduct invited by the offer.  Compare §§ 38 -40.  Ordinarily the 
making of an offer does not limit the offeree's freedom of action or inaction; he may act or forbear without reference to the offer.  But if he has reason to know that the offeror may reasonably infer from 
his conduct that he assents, he runs the risk of being bound by his manifestation of assent.  See §§ 19, 20.  He may guard against that risk by manifesting an intention not to accept.  Although a rejection does not terminate the power of acceptance until received by the offeror (§ 40), reasonable diligence to notify the offeror is sufficient to protect the offeree against an unintended acceptance, except as stated in § 69.  Thus Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -206(1)(b) provides that a shipment of 
nonconforming goods in response to an offer to buy is not an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.  See Illustrations 5 and 6 to § 32.  The exceptional cases covered by § 69 involve taking the benefit of 
offered goods or services, or prior conduct of the offeree justifying the offeror in inferring assent. 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 53  
 josh glen  Page 147 of 189 c.  Rejection or disclaimer where return promise is not contemplated .  Where no promise by the 
offeree is contemplated, there is no problem of justifiable reliance by the offeror.  See Comment d  to § 
23.  The offeree's conduct ordinarily constitutes an acceptance in such cases only if he knows of the 
offer.  His rendering of the invited performance with knowledge of the offer is a sufficient manifestation of assent, and inquiry into his motives is unnecessary.  But the meaning of non-verbal conduct is even more dependent on its setting than the meaning of words.  See Comment a to § 19.  The words or conduct of the offeree may show that he acts gratuitously, or otherwise without 
reference to the offer.  There is then no bargain.  See § 23.  Moreover, as in other cases where it is assumed that a promisee accepts a promise beneficial to him, disclaimer renders the promise inoperative from the beginning.  Compare §§ 104, 306.  The effect of disclaimer in violation of duty to third persons and the effect of disclaimer on the rights of third persons are beyond the scope of this Restatement.  See, e.g., Restatement, Second, Trusts §§ 35, 102. Illustrations:  
1.  A offers a reward for information leading to the conviction of a criminal.  B, a friend of the criminal, knows of the reward and gives the information voluntarily.  B is entitled to the rewar d even 
though he acts because he thinks he is about to die and wants both to ease his conscience and to revenge himself for a beating received from the criminal.  
2.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, B is interrogated by the police and threatened 
with arrest as an accomplice of the criminal.  During the interrogation, without any mention of the reward, B is tricked into giving the information to clear himself.  B is not entitled to the reward.  
3.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, B states after giving the information that he does not claim the reward.  B is not entitled to the reward. 
4.  A, an elderly widow apparently in dire poverty, promises B, a distant relative of her deceased 
husband, that she will pay for board and lodging in B's home.  B furnishes board and lodging to A for a year without requesting or receiving any payment, and on A's death states that nothing is due to B.  It is a question of fact on all the circumstances whether B has manifested an intenti on not to seek 
payment even if A is found to have left a substantial bank account. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is based on former § 55 but that Section's requirement of "intent to accept," is eliminated as out of harmony with other rules stating a requir ement of "manifestation of assent." See 1 Williston, 
Contracts §§ 65- 67A (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts §§ 58, 70 (1963 & Supp. 1980); Llewellyn,

In "Industrial America," Inc. v. Fulton Indus., 285 A.2d 412, 415- 16 (Del. 1971) , the court, after 
discussing several other authorities, quoted the text of this Section in Tentative Draft, and concluded that "the favored rule shifts the emphasis away from a manifestation of intent to accept to a mani festation of intent not to accept; thereby establishing, it would appear, a rebuttable presumption 
of acceptance when the offer invites acceptance by performance."

§ 54 Acceptance by Performance; Necessity of Notification to Offeror   
 
(1)  Where an offer invites an offeree to  accept by rendering a performance, no notification is 
necessary to make such an acceptance effective unless the offer requests such a notification.  
(2)  If an offeree who accepts by rendering a performance has reason to know that the offeror 
has no adequa te means of learning of the performance with reasonable promptness and 
certainty, the contractual duty of the offeror is discharged unless 
(a)  the offeree exercises reasonable diligence to notify the offeror of acceptance, or (b)  the offeror learns of the performance within a reasonable time, or 
(c)  the offer indicates that notification of acceptance is not required.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  In the usual commercial bargain the offeror expects and receives prompt notification of 
acceptance, and such notification is ordinarily essential to an acceptance by promise.  See § 56.  But 
where an offer invites the offeree to accept by rendering a performance, the offeree needs a dependable basis for his decision whether to accept.  Comp are § 63 and Comment a.  When the 
offeree performs or begins to perform in response to such an offer, there is need for protection of his justifiable reliance.  Compare § 45.  Those needs are met by giving the performance the effect of temporarily barring revocation of the offer; but ordinarily notification of the offeror must follow in due course.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206 Comment 3. b.  Performance operating as return promise .  This Section applies only to offers which invite 
acceptance by perf ormance.  Where the offeree is empowered to choose between acceptance by 
performance and acceptance by promise (see § 32), this Section applies only if he chooses to accept by performance.  See § 50(2).  In such a case the acceptance often carries with it a return commitment (see § 62), and it is rare that the offer dispenses with notification of such a commitment.  Compare §§ 56, 69.  Unless the performance will come to the offeror's attention in normal course, it is not likely to be a reasonable mode of acceptance.  See § 30.  In the exceptional case where acceptance is invited by a performance which will not come promptly to the offeror's attention, Subsection (2) usually requires notification of acceptance.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 206(2) provides that if no notification is 
sent within a reasonable time in such a case, the offeror may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.  Compare § 41.  
Illustration: 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 54  
 josh glen  Page 150 of 189 1.  A mails a written order to B for goods to be manufactured specially for A, and requests B to begin 
at once since manufacture will take several weeks.  Under § 62 acceptance is complete when B begins, but A's contractual duty is discharged and he may tr eat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance 
unless within a reasonable time B sends notification of acceptance or unless the offer or a prior course of dealing indicates that notification is not required. c.  Where no return promise is contemplated .  Performance may be invited as an alternative mode of 
acceptance or as the exclusive mode of acceptance.  See §§ 30, 32.  Where no return commitment is involved, the only notification of acceptance called for is often that necessarily involved in performanc e by the offeree, or that which accompanies the offeree's request for performance by the 
offeror.  Performance itself both manifests assent and furnishes consideration.  Notification is requisite only where the offeror has no convenient means of ascertaini ng whether the requisite performance has 
taken place.  Even then, it is not the notification which creates the contract, but lack of notification which ends the duty.  Compare § 224.  Moreover, the offeror may effectively waive notification either before or after the time when it would otherwise be due.  See § 84. Illustrations:  
2.  A, the proprietor of a medical preparation, offers $ 100 to anyone who contracts a certain disease after using the preparation as directed.  B uses it as directed.  B has accept ed the offer, and is entitled 
to the $ 100 if she later contracts the disease.  No notification to A is required until after B has contracted the disease.  
3.  A, a newspaper, requests B to discontinue distribution of a rival newspaper, and offers to pay B $ 10 per week as long as B abstains from such distribution.  B discontinues the distribution.  B has accepted the offer, and no notification to A is required. d.  Notice to guarantor .  This Section has an important application in the field of suretyship.  See 
Restatement of Security § 86.  An offer to become guarantor for another commonly invites the offeree to accept by advancing money, goods, or services on credit.  See Comment b to § 31.  Notification is 
not essential to acceptance of such an offer, and often is not necessary at all.  But Subsection (2) may apply to require notification unless the terms of the offer in the circumstances manifest a contrary intention.  An offer of guaranty which does not require notification is often called an "absolute guaranty," while an offer requiring notification is referred to as a "mere offer to guarantee." Where an offer of a continuing guaranty requires notification, a single notice of intention to act is ordinarily sufficient, and notice of individual transactions is not required. 
In guaranty cases, notification may be dispensed with if the offer uses language of completed 
contractual assent, or is under seal, or recites a nominal consideration, or contains an express waiver, or provides for termination by notifica tion of revocation.  Facts other than the written terms may have 
the same effect: a request for the offer made by the offeree, the offeror's knowledge of a particular intended credit transaction or participation in it, a prior course of dealing, a prior or  subsequent 
waiver, or a close relationship between the offeror and the principal obligor. Illustrations:  
4.  A, the president of a corporation, agrees to guarantee payment for goods to be sold to the corporation by B.  B sells and delivers the goods.  B has accepted A's offer, and no notification of acceptance is necessary.  
5.  A writes an informal letter to B, a friend in another country, saying, "If you will let my brother C have $ 100, I will guarantee its repayment." Promptly on receiving the letter, B  advances the money to 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 54  
 josh glen  Page 151 of 189 C, but B takes no steps to notify A, and A does not learn of the advance for a year.  B cannot enforce 
the guaranty if C fails to pay the debt. 
6.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 5, B receives a letter of revocat ion from A an 
hour after advancing the money.  B promptly mails a letter notifying A of the advance.  The guaranty 
is binding even though the letter never arrives.

§ 55 Acceptance of Non- Promissory Offers   
 
Acceptance by promise may create a contract in which the offeror's performance is completed 
when the offeree's promise is made.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  "Reverse unilateral contracts."   It is possible to offer a performance without making any promise.  
Like other offers, a non- promissory offer may require acceptance by performance or acceptance by 
promise or a combination of the two, or it may leave the mode of acceptance to the offeree's choice.  
An exchange of performances is not within the definition of "contract" in § 1 and is beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  But where a non- promissory offer is accepted by promise , there is 
a contract if the requirements other than manifestation of mutual assent are met.  Since the contract formed by a performance in response to an offer of a promise such as an offer of reward is often called a "unilateral contract," the type of contract referred to inthis Section is sometimes referred to as a "reverse unilateral contract." Contracts so referred to often involve incidental promises by the performing offeror, and in that event the word "unilateral" is not entirely appropriate. b.  Ty pes of non- promissory offers .  Most offers are themselves promises.  But if the offeror's 
performance is complete at the moment of acceptance, the element of futurity required by the definition of "promise" in § 2 is lacking.  Performance may be thus compl ete when the offer takes the 
form of a tender of money or other property; indeed, the acceptance of the offer may then be implied from the fact that the offeree takes the offered benefits, without more.  See § 69.  In such cases the offeree's manifestation  of assent may effect the transfer of property from offeror to offeree which 
furnishes consideration for the offeree's promise.  This element is lacking when services alone are offered, but a contract may nonetheless be formed if the offeree takes the benefit of the services.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A applies to B, an insurance company, for a policy of life insurance, and pays the first premium on an understanding that the insurance must be approved at B's home office.  B's notification that the approval has bee n given is an acceptance of A's offer and forms a contract of insurance.  
2.  A offers to lend B $ 100 on specified terms and tenders the money to B.  B's acceptance of the tender forms a contract on the terms specified.  
3.  A, the owner of a horse in B's possession, offers to sell the horse to B for $ 100 payable in thirty days.  On B's promise to pay in accordance with the offer, ownership of the horse is transferred to him and there is a contract.  Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(3). 
4.  A, a real estate broker, without authority from B, the owner of property, obtains from C an offer to

§ 56 Acceptance by Promise; Necessity of Notification to Offeror   
 
Except as stated in § 69 or where the offer manifests a contrary intention, it is essential to an 
acceptance by promise either that the offeree exercise reasonable diligence to notify the offeror of acceptance or that the offeror receive the acceptance seasonably.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Necessity of notification .  Where the offeree has performed in whole or in part, notification to the 
offeror is not essential to acceptance, although failure to notify may discharge the offeror's duty of performance.  See § 54.  Similarly, where the offeror has rendered a performance and the offeree has taken the benefit of that performance, the offeree may be bound without notification to the offeror.  See § 69.  In such cases the enforcement of the promise rests in part on a change of position in justifiable reliance on a promise, often reinforced by a corresponding benefit received by the promisor.  Section 69 also provides for some cases of offers which manifest an intention to dispense with notification.  In other cases of the exchange of promises which are entirely executory on both sides, the offeror is entitled to notificat ion of acceptance unless the offer manifests a contrary intention.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A gives an order to B Company's traveling salesman for a $ 2000 machine "to purify water of the character shown by sample to be submitted," shipment to be made in one month.  The order provides: "This proposal becomes a contract when approved by an executive officer of B Company at its home office." Notation of such approval on the order is an acceptance by promise without any notification, but A's duty to perform is conditional on reasonable notification to send the sample. 
2.  A makes written application for life insurance through an agent for B Insurance Company, pays the 
first premium, and is given a receipt stating that the insurance "shall take effect as of the date o f 
approval of the application" at B's home office.  Approval at the home office in accordance with B's usual practice is an acceptance of A's offer even though no steps are taken to notify A.  
b.  Failure of communication.  It is sometimes said that the acceptance must be communicated to the offeror, and when the parties deal face to face communication is ordinarily required.  The rule is more accurately stated as one requiring reasonable diligence on the part of the offeree, however, since in cases of misun derstanding acceptance turns on what each party knew or had reason to know.  See § 
20.  In cases of communication by mail or telegram, moreover, an acceptance may be effective on dispatch even though it fails to reach the addressee.  See § 63.  Failure of diligence becomes immaterial if the offeror receives the acceptance seasonably.  See § 67.  As to when a written acceptance is received, see § 68.  Compare Restatement, Second, Agency §§ 268 -83, Uniform 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 56  
 josh glen  Page 155 of 189 Commercial Code § 1 -201(25)- (27).  Of course reasonable diligence, or even receipt, is not enough if 
the terms of the offer require more.  See § 58.

§ 57 Effect of Equivocal Acceptance   
 
Where notification is essential to acceptance by promise, the offeror is not bound by an 
acceptance in equivocal terms unless he reasonably understands it as an acceptance.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Requirement of notification.  Notification of acceptance by promise is required in most 
circumstances.  See § 56.  Wh ere notification is dispensed with by the terms of the offer, the offeror 
cannot complain of the resulting uncertainty of his position.  See § 69.  In cases of acceptance by performance, the reliance of the offeree or the unjust enrichment of the offeror m ay justify a legal 
remedy for breach in spite of uncertainty in the offeror's position.  Compare §§ 34, 54.  Hence this Section is limited to cases of acceptance by promise in which notification is required.  
b.  Equivocation.  This Section is a particular application of the general principles stated in § 20.  Where notification is essential to acceptance by promise, the offeror is entitled to know in clear terms whether the offeree accepts his proposal.  It is not enough that the words of a reply justify a probable inference of assent.  But the circumstances may make it proper to protect an offeror who acts on such an inference.  Or subsequent conduct of one or both parties may bind one to an agreement in accordance with the understanding of the other.  Compare § 70. Illustrations:  
1.  A gives an order for goods to B's traveling salesman, subject to approval by B at his home office.  B sends a letter to A stating that the order has been received and will receive B's attention.  A promptly sends a letter of re vocation to B, which B receives before doing anything further.  There is 
no contract. 
2.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 1, A does not revoke, but after two months, when 
it is too late for A to procure substitute goods, B writes a letter to A stating that "it is necessary to cancel this order." B has broken a contract with A.  
3.  Pursuant to the terms of a lease from A to B, A writes to B that he is about to sell the premises and that B may have the option to purchase by meeting an offer of $ 37,000.  B replies, "I tender you $ 37,000 in exercise of my option rights.  I demand that I be notified concerning your acceptance or rejection of my offer within ten days." Within ten days, A notifies B that A has decided not to sell.  There is no  contract.  
4.  A writes to B offering to extend a lease for two years.  B replies, "I accept your offer, but I am assigning my interest to C, and have had a lease drawn up from you to C.  C has signed it in duplicate, and when you sign it will be complete.  Keep one copy and mail the other to me for C.  If this is not satisfactory let me know." A's letter of revocation crosses B's letter in the mail.  There is no contract.

§ 58 Necessity of Acceptance Complying with Terms of Offer   
 
An acceptance must comply with the requirements of the offer as to the promise to be made or 
the performance to be rendered.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Scope .  This rule applies to the substance of the bargain the basic principle that the offeror is the 
master of his offer.  See Comment a  to § 29.  That principle  rests on the concept of private autonomy 
underlying contract law.  It is mitigated by the interpretation of offers, in accordance with common understanding, as inviting acceptance in any reasonable manner unless there is contrary indication.  See §§ 20, 30(2), 32.  Usage of trade or course of dealing may permit inconsequential variations; or a variation clearly to the offeror's advantage, such as a reduction in the price of ordered goods, may be within the scope of theoffer.  But even in such cases the off eror is entitled, if he makes his meaning 
clear, to insist on a prescribed type of acceptance.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A offers to sell a book to B for $ 5 and states that no other acceptance will be honored but the mailing of B's personal check for exactly $ 5.  B personally tenders $ 5 in legal tender, or mails a personal check for $ 10.  There is no contract. 
2.  A offers to pay B $ 100 for plowing Flodden field, and states that acceptance is to be made only by 
posting a letter before beginning work and before the next Monday noon.  Before Monday noon B completes the requested plowing and mails to A a letter stating that the work is complete.  There is no contract.  
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is reworded from former § 59.  The qualification of the rule of that Section by former §§ 45, 63, and 72 is omitted.  Sections 45 and 69 of the present Restatement, successors to former §§ 45 and 72, protect the offeror against noncomplying acceptances, and hence are not exceptions.  The rule of former § 63 is abandoned.  See Reporter's Note to § 62.  The word "exactly," found in former § 59, is omitted as redundant in view of the word "requirement." See 1 Williston, Contracts § 73 (3d ed. 1957); 1 Corbin, Contracts § 86 (1963).

Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 59 Purported Acceptance Which Adds Qualifications   
 
A reply to an offer which purports to accept it but is conditional on the offeror's assent to terms 
additional to or different from those offered is not an acceptance but is a counter -offer.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Qualified acceptance .  A qualified or conditional acceptance proposes an exchange different from 
that proposed by the original offeror.  Such a proposal is a counte r-offer and ordinarily terminates the 
power of acceptance of the original offeree.  See § 39.  The effect of the qualification or condition is to deprive the purported acceptance of effect.  But a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance is operati ve despite the statement of additional or different terms if the acceptance is not made to depend 
on assent to the additional or different terms.  See § 61; Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 207(1).  The 
additional or different terms are then to be construed as proposals for modification of the contract.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -207(2).  Such proposals may sometimes be accepted by the 
silence of the original offeror.  See § 69. Illustration: 
1.  A makes an offer to B, and B in terms accepts but adds, "Thi s acceptance is not effective unless 
prompt acknowledgement is made of receipt of this letter." There is no contract, but a counter- offer.  
b.  Statement of conditions implied in offer .  To accept, the offeree must assent unconditionally to the 
offer as made, but the fact that the offeree makes a conditional promise is not sufficient to show that 
his acceptance is conditional.  The offer itself may either expressly or by implication propose that the offeree make a conditional promise as his part of the exchange.  By assenting to such a proposal the offeree makes a conditional promise, but his acceptance is unconditional.  The offeror's promise may also be conditional on the same or a different fact or event.  
Illustrations:  
2.  A makes a written offer to sell B a patent in exchange for B's promise to pay $ 10,000 if B's adviser X approves the purchase.  B signs the writing in a space labelled "Accepted:" and returns the writing to A.  B has made a conditional promise and an unconditional acceptance.  There is a contract, but B's 
duty to pay the price is conditional on X's approval. 
3.  A makes a written offer to B to sell him Blackacre.  By usage the offer is understood as promising 
a marketable title.  B replies, "I accept your offer if you can convey me a marketable title." There is a contract.

Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 60 Acceptance of Offer Which States Place, Time or Manner of Acceptance   
 
If an offer prescribes the place, time or manner of acceptance its terms in this respect must be 
complied with in or der to create a contract.  If an offer merely suggests a permitted place, time 
or manner of acceptance, another method of acceptance is not precluded.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Interpretation of offer .  If the offeror prescribes the only way in which his offer may be accepted, 
an acceptance in any other way is a counter -offer.  But frequently in regard to the details of methods 
of acceptance, the offeror's language, if fairly interpreted, amounts merely to a statement of a satisfactory method of acceptance, without positive requirement that this method shall be followed. Illustrations:  
1.  A mails an offer to B in which A says, "I must receive your acceptance by return mail." An acceptance sent within a reasonable time by any other means, which reaches A as soon as a letter sent 
by return mail would normally arrive, creates a contract on arrival.  As to what is a reasonable time, see Illustration 8 to § 41. 
2.  A makes an offer to B and adds, "Send your office boy around with an answer to this by twelve 
o'clock." The offeree comes himself before twelve o'clock and accepts.  There is a contract.  
3.  A offers to sell his land to B on certain terms, also saying: "You must accept this, if at all, in person at my office at ten o'clock tomorrow." B's power is strictly limited to one method of acceptance. 
4.  A offers to sell his land to B on certain terms, also saying: "You may accept by leaving word at my house." This indicates one operative mode of acceptance;  but B's power is not limited to that mode 
alone.  A personal statement to A would serve just as well. 
5.  A makes an offer to B and adds, "my address is 53 State Street." This is a business address.  B 
sends an acceptance to A's home which A receives promptly.  Unless the circumstances indicate that A has made a positive requirement of the place where the acceptance must be sent, there is a contract.

§ 61 Acceptance Which Requests Change of Terms   
 
An acceptance which requests a change or addition to the terms of the offer is not thereby 
invalidated unless the acceptance is made to depend on an assent to the changed or added terms.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Interpretation of acceptance .  An acceptance must be unequivocal.  But the mere inclusion of 
words requesting a modification of the proposed terms does not prevent a purported acceptance from closing the contract unless, if fairly interpreted, the offeree's assent depends on the offeror's further acquiescence in the modificat ion.  See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-207(1). 
Illustrations:  
1.  A offers to sell B 100 tons of steel at a certain price.  B replies, "I accept your offer.  I hope that if you can arrange to deliver the steel in weekly installments of 25 tons you will do s o." There is a 
contract, but A is not bound to deliver in installments. 
2.  A offers to sell specified hardware to B on stated terms.  B replies: "I accept your offer; ship in 
accordance with your statement.  Please send me also one No. 5 hand saw at your list price." The request for the saw is a separate offer, not a counter -offer.

§ 62 Effect of Performance by Offeree Where Offer Invites Either Performance or 
Promise   
 
(1)  Where an offer invites an offeree to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance 
by performance, the tender or beginning of the invited performance or a tender of a beginning 
of it is an acceptance by performance.  
(2)  Such an acceptance operates as a promise to render complete performance.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  The offeree's power to choose.  The offeror normally invites a promise by the offeree for the 
purpose of obtaining performance of the promise.  Full performance fulfills that purpose more directly than the promise invited, and hence constitutes a reasonable mode of acceptance.  The offeror can insist on any mode of acceptance, but ordinarily he invites acceptance in any reasonable manner; in case of doubt, an offer is interpreted as inviting the offeree to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance by performance.  See §§ 30, 32, 58. b.  Part performance or tender .  Where acceptance by performance is invited and no promise is 
invited, the beginning of performance or the tender of part performance creates an option contract and renders the offer irrevocable.  See §§ 37, 45.  Under Subsection (1) of this Section the offer is similarly rendered irrevocable where it invites the offeree to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance by performance.  In both types of cases, if the invited performance t akes time, the 
invitation to perform necessarily includes an invitation to begin performance; if performance requires cooperation by the offeror, there is an offer only if acceptance can be completed by tender of performance.  But unless an option contract  is contemplated, the offeree is expected to be bound as 
well as the offeror, and Subsection (2) of this Section states the implication of promise which results from that expectation.  See Illustration 5 to § 32.  In such standard cases as the shipment of goods in response to an order, the acceptance will come to the offeror's attention in normal course; in other cases, the rule of § 54(2) ordinarily requires prompt notification. c.  Manifestation of contrary intention .  The rule of Subsection (1), like the  rule of § 45, is designed to 
protect the offeree in justifiable reliance on the offeror's promise; both rules yield to a manifestation of intention which makes such reliance unjustified.  Moreover, in most cases of both types the offeree may prevent the formation of a contract by seasonably notifying the offeror of non- acceptance.  
Section 53(2).  Similarly, the rule of Subsection (2) is designed to preclude the offeree from speculating at the offeror's expense where no option contract is contemplated by t he offer (compare § 
63), and to protect the offeror in justifiable reliance on the offeree's implied promise; this rule also yields to a manifestation of contrary intention under § 53(2). 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 62  
 josh glen  Page 167 of 189 d.  Preparations for performance .  As under § 45, what is begun or tendered must be part of the actual 
performance invited, rather than preparation for performance, in order to make the rule of this Section 
applicable.  See Comment f  to § 45.  But preparations to perform may bring the case within § 87(2) on 
justifiable reliance.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A, a merchant, mails B, a carpenter in the same city, an offer to employ B to fit up A's office in accordance with A's specifications and B's estimate previously submitted, the work to be completed in two weeks.  The offer says, "You may begin at once," and B immediately buys lumber and begins to work on it in his own shop.  The next day, before B has sent a notice of acceptance or begun work at A's office or rendered the lumber unfit for other jobs, A revokes the offer.  The revoc ation is timely, 
since B has not begun to perform. 
2.  A, a regular customer of B, orders fragile goods from B which B carries in stock and ships in his 
own trucks.  Following his usual practice, B selects the goods ordered, tags them as A's, crates them and loads them on a truck at substantial expense.  Performance has begun, and A's offer is irrevocable.  
See Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -206 and Comment 2. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is modified from former § 63.  That Section stated that performance is an effective 
acceptance even if the offer requires acceptance by promise.  Thus the rule was made an exception to former §§ 52 and 59.  Those exceptions mitigated the effect of former § 31, which stated a presumption that an offer invites acceptance by promise.  Section 32 of the present Restatement states that in case of doubt an offer invites either acceptance by promise or acceptance by performance, as the offeree chooses.  This change makes unnecessary these departures from the basic principle that the offeror is master of his offer.  See Goble, Is Performance Always As Desirable as a Promise to Perform?, 22 Ill. L. Rev. 789 (1928); Llewellyn, Our Case -Law of Contract: Offer and Acceptance, II, 
48 Yale L.J. 779, 809 (1939). Cf. 1 Corbin, Contracts § 88 (1963 & Supp. 1980).  1 Williston, Contracts § 78A (3d ed. 1957); Annots., 19 A.L.R. 476 (1922), 29 A.L.R. 1352 (1924). See also Uniform Commercial Code § 2-207. 
Comment b .  The extension of § 45 to cases of mutual promises is supported by the following cas es, in 
which former § 45 was relied on to uphold contracts treated as containing promises by the offerees: 
Hollidage v. Gussow, Kahn & Co., 67 F.2d 459 (1st Cir. 1933)  (order for pamphlets in installments); 
Lyon v. Goss, 19 Cal.2d 659, 123 P.2d 11 (1942)  (lease conditional on procurement of subleases); 
Petroleum Research Corp. v. Barnsdall Ref. Corp., 188 Okl. 62, 105 P.2d 1047 (1940)  (experimental 
testing of oil -refining process).  In the following cases, involving exclusive listing with a real estate 
broker, the court relied on the original § 45, but a promise of reasonable diligence could easily have 
been found.  McManus v. Newcomb, 61 A.2d 36 (D.C. 1948) ; Bell v. Dimmerling, 149 Ohio St. 165,

Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 63 Time When Acceptance Takes Effect   
 
Unless the offer provides otherwise,  
(a)  an acceptance made in a manner and by a medium invited by an offer is operative and 
completes the manifestation of mutual assent as soon as put out of the offeree's possession, without regard to whether it ever reaches the offeror; but  
(b)  an acceptance under an option contract is not operative until received by the offeror.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  It is often said that an offeror who makes an offer by mail makes the post office his 
agent to receive the acceptance, or that the mailing of a letter of acceptance puts it irrevocably out of the offeree's control.  Under United States postal  regulations, however, the sender of a letter has long 
had the power to stop delivery and reclaim the letter.  A better explanation of the rule that the acceptance takes effect on dispatch is that the offeree needs a dependable basis for his decision wheth er to accept.  In many legal systems such a basis is provided by a general rule that an offer is 
irrevocable unless it provides otherwise.  The common law provides such a basis through the rule that a revocation of an offer is ineffective if received after  an acceptance has been properly dispatched.  
See Comment c  to § 42.  Acceptance by telegram is governed in this respect by the same 
considerations as acceptance by mail.  
Illustration: 
1.  A makes B an offer, inviting acceptance by telegram, and B duly tel egraphs an acceptance.  A 
purports to revoke the offer in person or by telephone or telegraph, but the attempted revocation is 
received by B after the telegram of acceptance is dispatched.  There is no effective revocation.  
b.  Loss or delay in transit .  In the interest of simplicity and clarity, the rule has been extended to cases 
where an acceptance is lost or delayed in the course of transmission.  The convenience of the rule is less clear in such cases than in cases of attempted revocation of the of fer, however, and the language 
of the offer is often properly interpreted as making the offeror's duty of performance conditional upon receipt of the acceptance.  Indeed, where the receipt of notice is essential to enable the offeror to perform, such a condition is normally implied.  See Comment c  to § 226.

2.  A offers to buy cotton from B, the operator of a cotton gin, B to accept by specifying the number of bales in a telegram sent before 8 p.m. thesame day.  B duly sends a telegram of acceptance and ships the cotton, but the telegram is not delivered.  There is a contract, and A is bound to take and pay for the cotton.

 josh glen  Page 170 of 189 3.  A mails to B an offer to lease land, stating, "Telegraph me Yes or No.  If I do not hear from you by 
noon on Friday, I shall conclude No." B duly telegraphs "Yes," but the telegram is not delivered until after noon on Friday.  Any contract formed by the telegraphic acceptance is discharged. 
4.  A offers to buy cattle for B, on an understanding that if B telegraphs "Yes" A will notify B of the 
amount of money needed and B will supply it.  B's "Yes" telegram is duly dispatched but does not arrive within a reasonable time.  Any contract formed by the dispatch of the telegram is discharged.  
c.  Revocation of acceptance .  The fact that the offeree has power to reclaim his acceptance from the 
post office or telegraph company does not prevent the acceptance from taking effect on dispatch.  Nor, in the absence of additional circumstances, does the actual recapture of the accepta nce deprive it of 
legal effect, though as a practical matter the offeror cannot assert his rights unless he learns of them.  An attempt to revoke the acceptance by an overtaking communication is similarly ineffective, even though the revocation is received before the acceptance is received.  After mailing an acceptance of a 
revocable offer, the offeree is not permitted to speculate at the offeror's expense during the time required for the letter to arrive.  
A purported revocation of acceptance may, however, affect the rights of the parties.  It may amount to an offer to rescind the contract or to a repudiation of it, or it may bar the offeree by estoppel from enforcing it.  In some cases it may be justified as an exercise of a right of stoppage in transit or a demand for assurance of performance.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2- 609, 2- 702, 2 -705.  
Or the contract may be voidable for mistake or misrepresentation, §§ 151- 54, 164.  See particularly 
the provisions of § 153 on unilateral mistake. Illustration s: 
5.  A mails to B a note payable by C with instructions to collect the amount of the note and remit by mailing B's own check.  At C's request B mails his own check as instructed.  Subsequently, at C's request, B recovers his letter and check from the post office.  The recovery does not discharge the contract formed by the mailing of B's check.  But if B is a bank, its remittance may be provisional under Uniform Commercial Code § 4-211. 
6.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 5, B recovers his letter and check from the post 
office because he has learned that C is insolvent and cannot reimburse B.  B is entitled to rescind the contract for mistake.  See §§ 153-54; compare Uniform Commercial Code § 4-212. 
7.  A mails an offer to B to appoint B  A's exclusive distributor in a specified area.  B duly mails an 
acceptance.  Thereafter B mails a letter which is received by A before the acceptance is received and 
which rejects the offer and makes a counter -offer.  On receiving the rejection and before  receiving the 
acceptance, A executes a contract appointing C as exclusive distributor instead of B.  B is estopped to enforce the contract.  Compare § 40. 
8.  The Government mails to A an offer to pay the amount quoted by him for the manufacture of two 
sets of ship propellers, and A mails an acceptance.  A then discovers that by mistake he has quoted the price for a single set, and so informs the Government by a telegram which arrives before the acceptance.  A's mailing the acceptance created a contract.  The question whether the contract is voidable for mistake is governed by the rules stated in §§ 153-54. d.  Other types of cases.  The question when and where an acceptance takes effect may arise in determining the application of tax and regulatory laws, choice of governing law, venue of litigation, and other issues.  Such cases often turn on policies beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  To the extent that the issue is referred to the rule governing private contract disputes, the 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 63  
 josh glen  Page 171 of 189 rules stated in this Section are applicable.  Where the issue is what obligation is imposed by a contract, 
whether those rules apply is ordinarily a matter of interpretation.  
Illustrations:  
9.  A mails to B an offer to buy goods, and B mails an acceptance.  The application of a new tax statute depends on when title to the goods passes to A, and under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(3) (b) title passes at the time of contracting.  The time of contracting is the time when B's acceptance is mailed.  
10.  A offers to insu re B's house against fire, the insurance to take effect upon actual payment of the 
premium, and invites B to reply by mailing his check for a specified amount.  B duly mails the check.  While B's letter is in transit, the house burns.  The loss is within the period of insurance coverage.  
e.  The offeree's possession .  The rule of Subsection (1) gives effect to an acceptance when "put out of 
the offeree's possession." Its principal application is to the use of mail and telegraph, but it would apply equally t o any other similar public service instrumentality, even though the instrumentality may 
for some purposes be the offeree's agent.  See Restatement, Second, Agency § 1.  It may also apply to a private messenger service which is independent of the offeree and can be relied on to keep accurate records.  But, except where the Government or a telegraph company can make use of its own postal or telegraph facilities, communication by means of the offeree's employee is excluded; the employee's possession is treated  as that of the employer. 
Illustration: 
11.  A makes B an offer by mail, or messenger, and B promptly sends an acceptance by his own 
employee.  There is no contract until the acceptance is received by the offeror.  As to receipt, see § 68.  
f.  Option contr acts.  An option contract provides a dependable basis for decision whether to exercise 
the option, and removes the primary reason for the rule of Subsection (1).  Moreover, there is no objection to speculation at the expense of a party who has irrevocably assumed that risk.  Option contracts are commonly subject to a definite time limit, and the usual understanding is that the notification that the option has been exercised must be received by the offeror before that time.  Whether or not there is such a time limit, in the absence of a contrary provision in the option contract, the offeree takes the risk of loss or delay in the transmission of the acceptance and remains free to revoke the acceptance until it arrives.  Similarly, if there is such a mistake on  the part of the offeror as 
justifies the rescission of his unilateral obligation, the right to rescind is not lost merely because a letter of acceptance is posted.  See §§ 151 -54. 
Illustrations:  
12.  A, for consideration, gives B an option to buy property, written notice to be given on or before a specified date.  Notice dispatched before but not received until after that date is not effective to exercise the option.  
13.  A submits a bid to supply goods to the Government, which becomes irrevocable when bids are opened.  Within a reasonable time the Government mails a notice of award of the contract to A.  Until A receives the notice, there is no contract binding on the Government.

The message was not received by the Government's communications office in Houston until the next morning and was transm itted to the attorney within half an hour.  The court had no difficulty finding that an 
acceptance did not take place until the second day, and thus was untimely.  Illustration 11 is new; see

§ 64 Acceptance by Telephone or Teletype   
 
Acceptance given by telephone or other medium of substantially instantaneous two -way 
communication is governed by the principles applicable to acceptances where the parties are in 
the presence of each other.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  Where the parties are in each other's presence, the offeree can accept without being in 
doubt as to whether the offeror has attempted to revoke his offer or whether the offeror has received the acceptance.  His need of a dependable basis for decision wh ether to accept is therefore met without 
the rules stated in § 63.  The situation prevents the question from arising whether a revocation of the offer or acceptance can be effective during the period required for communication of the acceptance, and all th at remains is the risk of misunderstanding.  Where the parties are not in each other's 
presence, but are able to communicate with each other without any substantial lapse of time, the situation is similar and the governing principles are the same.  
b.  Fail ure of communication.  Where the parties are in each other's presence, ambiguities and 
misunderstandings, if perceived by either party, can be cleared up on the spot.  The governing rules where a misunderstanding is not corrected are stated in § 20.  The risk of failure of telephone, teletype or other similar communication is similar in that ordinarily one or both parties will know or have reason to know of the failure, and the same principles apply.  If one party has reason to know of a failure of communication and hence that the other party's understanding may be different from his own, he runs the risk of being held to a manifestation of assent unless he takes immediate steps to clear up any misunderstanding.  But if both parties are equally innocent or equally at fault, there is no contract.  
Illustrations:  
1.  A makes an offer to B by telephone.  The telephone connection is then broken, but B speaks an acceptance in ignorance of the break.  A's failure to answer gives B reason to know of the break.  There  is no contract.  
2.  A makes an offer to B by teletype.  B transmits an acceptance, and A knows that a reply has been transmitted; but a mechanical failure at A's end, unknown to B, prevents A from learning the contents of the reply.  There is a contract. c.  Place of contracting.  The question where an acceptance takes effect may arise in cases turning on 
policies beyond the scope of the Restatement of this Subject.  Compare Comment d  to § 63.  To the 
extent that the issue is referred to the rule governing  private contract disputes, the analogy of 
acceptance by mail or telegram is controlling in cases of contracts made by parties in each other's 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 64  
 josh glen  Page 175 of 189 presence and also in cases of contracts made by telephone or teletype: the contract is created at the 
place where  the acceptor speaks or otherwise completes his manifestation of assent.  See, e.g., 
Restatement, Second, Conflict of Laws § 332, Comment b. 
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is rewritten from former § 65.  See 1 Williston, Contracts § 82A (3d ed. 1957); 1 Cor bin, 
Contracts § 79 (1963). Comment b .  Illustrations 1 and 2 are based on dicta of Denning, L.J. in Entores Ltd. v. Miles, Far East 
Corp., [1955] 2 Q.B. 327 (C.A.). 
Comment c .  In several cases issues of jurisdiction or choice of law have led the court in to an 
extensive discussion of the issue, largely theoretical in contracts law, whether acceptance by telegraph, 
telephone or a similar electronic medium is effective upon dispatch or upon receipt.In Linn v. 
Employers Reins. Corp., 392 Pa. 58, 139 A.2d 638 (1958) , the court, citing numerous cases, said that 
former § 65, requiring receipt, "represents a sound theoretical view," but that the reported cases "are uniform in holding that by analogy to the situations in which acceptance is mailed or telegraphed, an acceptance by telephone is effective, and a contract is created at the place where the acceptor speaks." In Entores Ltd. v. Miles Far East Corp., supra, Denning, L.J., followed the reasoning of former § 65 in arriving at the conclusion that the place of contracting was where a teletyped acceptance was received, but indicated that the American law was otherwise.  All the cases found deal with the issue of place of 
contracting.  See, e.g., Lipshutz v. Gordon Jewelry Corp., 373 F. Supp. 375 (S.D. Tex. 1974) ; Pierce v. 
Foley Bros., 283 Minn. 360, 168 N.W.2d 346 (1969) .

Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 65 Reasonableness of Medium of Acceptance   
 
Unless circumstances known to the offeree indicate otherwise, a medium of acceptance is 
reasonable if it is the one used by  the offeror or one customary in similar transactions at the 
time and place the offer is received.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Significance of use of reasonable medium .  Under § 30 an offer invites acceptance by any 
reasonable medium unless ther e is contrary indication; under § 63 an acceptance so invited is 
ordinarily effective upon dispatch.  If an unreasonable medium of acceptance is used, on the other hand, the governing rule is that stated in § 67.  Thus if an offer is made by mail, an acceptance by mail is ordinarily effective on dispatch.  Exception is made by this section if circumstances known to the offeree indicate otherwise, by § 63 if the offer otherwise provides, and by § 30 if the offer or circumstances forbid acceptance by mail regardless of reasonableness.  
b.  Circumstances relevant to reasonableness.  This Section specifies certain circumstances which 
ordinarily indicate that a particular medium of acceptance is reasonable, but it does not exhaust the circumstances which may be relevant.  Among the relevant circumstances not specified in this Section may be the speed and reliability of the medium, a prior course of dealing between the parties, and a usage of trade.  See Chapter 9.  The concept of reasonableness is flexible, and its  applicability may be 
enlarged as newmedia develop or existing media become more speedy or reliable or come into more general use.  See Comment 1 to Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206. c.  Mail.  Acceptance by mail is ordinarily reasonable where the parties a re negotiating at a distance, 
unless there is some special reason for speed such as rapid price fluctuation.  Compare § 41.  The same is true when the parties are located in the same city, if the offer is in writing, even though it is left with the offeree  in person or delivered to his messenger.  Even though an offer is transmitted by 
telephone or telegraph, acceptance by mail may well be reasonable.  
Illustration: 
1.  By telegram A in Oklahoma orders two car -loads of potatoes from B in Wisconsin.  B wires back 
an acceptance "if you will give us time to fill." Immediately on receiving B's reply A mails a 
confirming letter stating "we wish if possible you would ship at once" and giving shipping instructions.  A has accepted B's counter -offer by a reasonable medium of acceptance.  
d.  Telegraph .  Acceptance by telegram or mailgram is affected by the same considerations as 
acceptance by mail.  In addition, there is a risk of mistake in transmission which may be provided for by agreement or may be reduced by a pra ctice of confirmation by mail or by use of repeated messages.  
Notwithstanding that risk, telegraphic communication is now sufficiently reliable that telegraphic 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 65  
 josh glen  Page 177 of 189 acceptance of an offer made by mail is ordinarily reasonable.  But a contrary provision in the offer or a 
course of dealing or usage of trade requiring confirmation by mail is effective.  See Comment c  to § 
221.

§ 66 Acceptance Must Be Properly Dispatched   
 
An acceptance sent by mail or otherwise from a distance is not operative when dispatched, 
unless it is properly addressed and such other precautions taken as are ordinarily observed to insure safe transmission of similar messages.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Rationale .  Under § 50, acceptance by promise is not effective until the offeree has completed 
every act essential to the making of the promise.  Reasonable diligence to notify is essential under § 56, except as stated in § 69.  It follows that, notwithstanding § 63, acceptance by mail or telegram is not effective on dispatch unless the acceptor exercises reasonable diligence to notify the offeror.  Compare the rules as to acceptance by performance stated in § 54.  This Section specifies what constitutes reasonable diligence: it would be most unusual for an offer to invite acceptance by the sending, for example, of a misdirected letter or telegram. b.  Proper address.  The offeree may fulfill the requirement that an acceptance be properly addressed by using a return address indicated in the offer, whether in a letterhead or otherwise.  But any other place held out by the offeror as the place for receipt of such communications will do as well.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code § 1 -201(26).  Whether a reply to an offer may properly be sent 
to a residential address not specified in the negotiations depends on the circumstances.  If the acceptance is duly received despite misdirection, the rule of § 67 may apply. c.  Other precautions .  The other precautions to be taken depend on what is ordinarily observed to 
insure safe transmission of similar messages.  In cases of acceptance by mail, the postal regulations are ordinarily controlling on such matters as the necessity for prepayment of postage.  In un usual 
circumstances, however, as when the mails are stopped by war, reasonable diligence may require more than compliance with postal regulations.  Unless the offeror manifests a contrary intention, an acceptance is not effective on dispatch if the offeree knows or has reason to know that it will not reach 
the offeror.

§ 67 Effect of Receipt of Acceptance Improperly Dispatched   
 
Where an acceptance is seasonably dispatched but the offeree uses means of transmission not 
invited by the offer or fails to exercise reasonable diligence to insure safe transmission, it is treated as operative upon dispatch if received within the time in which a properly dispatched acceptance would normally have arrived.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Improper medium of transmission .  Ordinarily an offer invites acceptance by any reasonable 
medium, and acceptance by such a medium is operative on dispatch.  See §§ 30, 63, 65.  An acceptance which is not operative on dispatch may be operative on its receipt by the offeror.  The rule 
stated in this Section goes further: once the acceptance reaches the offeror, the means of transmission becomes immaterial.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code § 1 -201(38).  Since the offeror's interest in 
receiving notification is satisfied, the of feree is not permitted to disavow his own act, and the usual 
rules are applied to bind both parties at the same instant.  Just as if the acceptance had been properly dispatched, a revocation of the offer which crosses the acceptance in the mail, or an over taking letter 
revoking the acceptance, is ineffective.  Of course the offer may provide for a contrary rule.  And the rule is limited to acceptance seasonably dispatched: the offeree is not empowered to use for speculation the time allowed for communicatio n.  See Comment f  to § 41. 
Illustration: 
1.  A makes an offer to B by telegram on Monday, requesting a reply by telegram to be sent no later 
than Thursday noon.  B mails an acceptance on Monday which A receives on Thursday morning.  Even if the mail is an unreasonable medium of acceptance under the circumstances, a revocation of the offer by A by telephone on Tuesday, or a revocation of the acceptance by B by telephone, is ineffective.  
b.  Misdirection and the like .  The same rule applies to cases where the offeree uses the wrong address 
or fails to provide for postage or other cost of transmission.  In such cases the offeree takes the risk of loss or delay in transmission.  See §§ 63, 66.  But it is not uncommon for communications to arrive promptly despite  misdirection or the omission of ordinary precautions to insure safe transmission.  In 
such cases the improper dispatch becomes immaterial.  
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is modified from former § 68.  That Section dealt only with the means of transmission;  
the provision for failure to take precautions is new.  The provision that timely receipt has the effect of a proper sending is also new; it conforms to Uniform Commercial Code § 1- 201(38) and to the

§ 68 What Constitutes Receipt of Revocation, Rejection, or Acceptance   
 
A written revocation, rejection, or acceptance is received when the writing comes into the 
possessio n of the person addressed, or of some person authorized by him to receive it for him, or 
when it is deposited in some place which he has authorized as the place for this or similar communications to be deposited for him.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Point of receipt .  Under § 42, a revocation if sent from a distance must be received in order to be 
effectual.  Under § 63 acceptance from a distance need not be received if started on its way in a method authorized, unless receipt is made a condition of the offer.  This, however, may be the case; and though there is no such condition, an acceptance sent by an unauthorized method may, under § 67, create a contract when received by the offeror.  What amounts to receipt in all these cases is defined by the present Section, under which a written communication may be received though it is not read or though it does not even reach the hands of the person to whom it is addressed.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code § 1 -201(26) on when a notification is received, and § 1- 201(27) on receipt by an 
organization. Illustrations:  
1.  A sends B by mail an offer dated from A's house and states as a condition of the offer that an acceptance must be received within three days.  B mails an acceptance which reaches A's house and is delivered to a servant or is deposited in a mail box at the door within three days; but A has been called away from home and does not personally receive the letter for a week.  There is a contract.  
2.  A sends B by mail an offer, but later, desiring to revoke the offer, telegraphs B to that effect.  The messenger boy carrying the telegram from the receiving office meets C, B's neighbor, who volunteers to carry the telegram to B, and accordingly is given it by the messenger boy.  C forgets to deliver i t to 
B until the following morning.  An acceptance by B mailed prior to this time creates a contract.

Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 69 Acceptance by Silence or Exercise of Dominion   
 
(1)  Where an offeree fails to reply to an offer, his silence and inaction operate as an acceptance 
in the following cases only:  
(a)  Where  an offeree takes the benefit of offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject 
them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation.  
(b)  Where the offeror has stated or given the offeree reason to understand that assent may be 
manifested by silence or inaction, and the offeree in remaining silent and inactive intends to accept the offer.  
(c)  Where because of previous dealings or otherwise, it is reasonable that the offeree should 
notify the offeror if he does not intend to accept.  
(2)  An offeree who does any act inconsistent with the offeror's ownership of offered property is bound in accordance with the offered terms unless they are manifestly unreasonable.  But if the act is wrongful as against the offeror it is  an acceptance only if ratified by him.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Acceptance by silence is exceptional .  Ordinarily an offeror does not have power to cause the 
silence of the offeree to operate as acceptance.  See Comment b to § 53.  The usual  requirement of 
notification is stated in § 54 on acceptance by performance and § 56 on acceptance by promise.  The mere receipt of an unsolicited offer does not impair the offeree's freedom of action or inaction or impose on him any duty to speak.  The exceptional cases where silence is acceptance fall into two main classes: those where the offeree silently takes offered benefits, and those where one party relies on the other party's manifestation of intention that silence may operate as acceptance.  Even in those cases the contract may be unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.  See Chapter 5.  
b.  Acceptance of offered services.  Services rendered cannot be recovered in specie, and there is in 
general no right to restitution of the value of services rendered officiously or gratuitously.  Even where services are rendered by mistake, the right to restitution is limited.  See Restatement of Restitution §§ 40-42, 56.  But when the recipient knows or has reason to know that the services are being rendered 
with an expectation of compensation, and by a word could prevent the mistake, his privilege of 
inaction gives way; under Subsection (1) (a) he is held to an acceptance if he fails to speak.  The resulting duty is not merely a duty to pay fair value, but a duty to pay or perform according to the terms of the offer.  
Illustration: 
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 69  
 josh glen  Page 185 of 189 1.  A gives several lessons on the violin to B's child, intending to give the child a course of twenty 
lessons, and to charge B the price.  B never requested A to give this instruction but silently allows the lessons to be continued to their end, having reason to know A's intention.  B is bound to pay the price of the course. c.  Intent to accept .  The mere fact that an offeror states that silence will constitute acceptance does not 
deprive the offeree of his privilege to remain silent without accepting.  But the offeree is entitled to 
rely on such a statement if he chooses.  The case for acceptance is strongest when the reliance is definite and substantial or when the intent to accept is  objectively manifested though not 
communicated to the offeror.  Compare §§ 54, 87(2).  Even though the intent to accept is manifested only by silent inaction, however, the offeror who has invited such an acceptance cannot complain of the resulting uncerta inty in his position. 
Illustrations:  
2.  A offers by mail to sell to B a horse already in B's possession for $ 250, saying: "I am so sure that you will accept that you need not trouble to write me.  Your silence alone will operate as acceptance." B makes n o reply, but he does not intend to accept.  There is no contract. 
3.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 2, B replies by return mail, saying: "I accept your offer." There is a contract.  
4.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustrati on 2, B makes no reply and remains inactive with 
the intention of thereby expressing his acceptance.  There is a contract.  
d.  Prior conduct of the offeree .  Explicit statement by the offeree, usage of trade, or a course of 
dealing between the parties may give the offeror reason to understand that silence will constitute acceptance.  In such a situation the offer may tacitly incorporate that understanding, and if the offeree intends to accept the case then falls within Subsection (1) (b).  Under Subsection (1) (c) the offeree's silence is acceptance, regardless of his actual intent, unless both parties understand that no acceptance is intended.  See § 20. 
In a number of recurring situations, statutes have codified the application of theses rules.  See Unifor m 
Commercial Code § 2 -207(2) on additional terms proposed in an acceptance or written confirmation 
of a contract between merchants for the sale of goods, § 2- 327(1) on retention of goods sold on 
approval, § 4- 302 on retention by a bank of commercial paper received for payment or acceptance.  In 
many states by statute or decision an insurance company is under a duty to act without unreasonable 
delay on insurance applications solicited by its agents; circumstances may be such as to give the applicant reason t o understand that he is insured if that duty is not performed, particularly where a 
premium payment has been made.  Compare § 56. Illustrations:  
5.  A, through salesmen, has frequently solicited orders for goods from B, the orders to be subject to A's personal approval.  In every case A has shipped the goods ordered within a week and without other notification to B than billing the goods to him on shipment.  A's salesman solicits and receives another order from B.  A receives the order and remains silent.  B relies on the order and forbears to buy elsewhere for a week.  A is bound to fill the order. 
6.  A has for years insured B's property against fire under annual policies.  At the expiration of one 
policy, in accordance with the usual practice, A sends B a  renewal policy and a bill for the premium.  
B retains the policy for two months and then refuses to pay the premium on demand.  B is liable for the premium accrued prior to his rejection. .  
 
Restat 2d of Contracts, § 69  
 josh glen  Page 186 of 189 e.  Exercise of dominion .  An offeree in possession of offered property commonly has a duty or 
privilege to hold it for the offeror, or, if storage, is inconvenient or hazardous, to return it, sell it for 
the offeror's account, or otherwise dispose of it.  Compare Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2-602 through 2- 604, 7- 206.  But the offeree's privilege to remain silent without accepting does not extend to 
acts of ownership not assented to by the offeror.  Hence exercise of dominion, even though not intended as acceptance under Subsection (1) (b) and not given meaning by prior conduct under Subsection (1) (c), is a sufficient manifestation of assent under Subsection (2).  Compare Uniform Commercial Code § 2 -606. 
Where the exercise of dominion does not comply with the terms of the offer, the offeror is not bound to treat it as an  acceptance but may instead pursue his remedies for tortious interference with his 
property.  But the offeree is not ordinarily permitted to avoid contract obligation by asserting that he is a tortfeasor rather than a promisor; atthe option of the offeror he may be held to an acceptance despite his manifestation of a contrary intention.  Such an obligation may fairly be characterized as quasi -
contractual rather than contractual, but its terms are fixed by the offer rather than by the fair value of the prope rty.  Compare Restatement of Restitution § 56.  
An exception is made where the offered terms are manifestly unreasonable.  In such cases the offeror has reason to know that no acceptance is intended, and the offered terms do not serve as an administratively  convenient substitute for fair value.  Particularly where the offeror seeks to take 
unconscionable advantage of a mistake made in good faith, no social purpose is served by an award plainly in excess of reasonable value even though the exercise of dominio n is tortious. 
Illustrations:  
7.  A sends B a one -volume edition of Shakespeare with a letter, saying, "If you wish to buy this book 
send me $ 6.50 within one week after receipt hereof, otherwise notify me and I will forward postage for return." B examines  the book and without replying makes a gift of it to his wife.  B owes A $ 6.50. 
8.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 7, B examines the book and without replying carefully lays it on a shelf to await A's messenger.  There is no contract.  
9.  The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 7, B examines the book and uses it or gives it to his wife, writing A at the same time that he has taken the book, but that it is worth only $ 5 and that he will pay no more.  A may at his option tre at B as a tort -feasor or as contracting to pay $ 6.50. 
10.  Under a claim of right made in error but in good faith, A digs a well on B's unused land and takes water therefrom which has no market value and no value to B, doing no injury to the value of the land.  B notifies A that he will charge A $ 50 a day for every day on which A takes water from his land.  Even after it is adjudicated that A's right is nonexistent, A does not accept B's terms by taking water.  
REPORTER'S NOTES  
This Section is based on for mer § 72.  Subsection (1) (c) is revised to harmonize with the common 
reference to "duty to speak" in judicial discussion.  Subsection (2) is revised to conform to the language of Uniform Commercial Code § 2- 606, and the exclusion of offered terms which ar e 
"manifestly unreasonable" is new.

Topic 5 - Acceptance of Offers  
 
§ 70 Effect of Receipt by Offeror of a Late or Otherwise Defective Acceptance   
 
A late or otherwise defective acceptance may be effective as an offer to the original offeror, but 
his silence operates as an acceptance in such a case only as stated in § 69.  
COMMENTS & ILLUSTRATIONS  
Comment:  
a.  Counter- offers.  A purported acceptance conditional on a change of terms commonly has the effect 
of a counter -offer .  In such cases the original offeror has not ordinarily given the original offeree 
reason to understand that silence will operate as an acceptance of a counter -offer.  Moreover, although 
an acceptance would not call for a reply, a purported acceptance is not ordinarily a sufficient manifestation of assent to silence as acceptance of the counter -offer.  Nor can the original offeror 
"waive" his right to reject, or at his election regard the counter- offer as an acceptance.  But the original 
offeror may have a  duty to speak, for example, if the purported acceptance embodies a plausible but 
erroneous reading of the original offer.  Compare § 20. Illustration: 
1.  A offers by mail to sell B 100 acres of land "for $ 15 per acre cash and give you till July 18 to 
accept." On July 1 A receives from B a purported acceptance not accompanied by the cash.  A waits until after July 18 and then notifies B that his acceptance was ineffective because the price was not paid by July 18.  There is a contract.  Any ambiguity in the quoted language is resolved against A in view of his failure to object to B's interpretation. b.  Late acceptance .  Where an offer is subject to a definite time limit, the offeree commonly is in as 
good a position as the offeror to ascertain whether he has made a timely acceptance.  A late acceptance may be an offer which can be accepted by the original offeror, but there is no more reason to treat silence as acceptance than in any other case.  But if the original offer lapses only on the expiration of an indefinite reasonable time, the failure of the original offeror to object to an acceptance and his subsequent preparations for performance may be evidence that the acceptance was made within a reasonable time.  
Illustration: 
2.  A invites B to make an offer to buy hay in A's barn.  On Friday B inspects the hay and mails A an 
offer which is received the following day.  The following Thursday A mails B an acceptance which is received the following day, and B then employs a third party to haul the hay.  There is a contract.
